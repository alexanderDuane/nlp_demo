"{\"0\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin\"},\"1\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"We bought this to backup the iMac G5 that I got my wife for Christmas. I have had an APC since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area.The overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money.I'm not sure if the Powerchute software was updated to run on Mac Tiger, howvever, so I did not install it.Steve Reis\"},\"2\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"It's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw -- beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power.  This person obviously didn't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the UPS.  The notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software.I agree that I was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem.  Luckily, it was easy to turn this feature off.Five stars for this product, for sure.\"},\"3\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage.\"},\"4\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"I already knew how good this product was before we bought it.  We had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer.

But I was just so thrilled to have only lost an $80.00 (at that time) product and not a $1,200 computer.

It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works.

It's a nice and fun way to store your CDs\"},\"12\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if  I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home. Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before. I will address the concerns of a few reviews here.1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD  audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound.2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc.3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc.4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I  bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable\\/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player\\/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires\\/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black.Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00.5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle.Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one.But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables. \"},\"13\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\" I was blown away by the sound quality.

However, I had my doubts so I ordered it anyway and it's great.  No buzzing noise on mine at all.  I have an apartment and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that I couldn't really use anyway because of noise restrictions.  This system is nice and clear and gives me the Home Theater Experience I was looking for.  They give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall.  Granted the speaker wire isn't all that thick, and has a proprietary male\\/female connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain.

It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.

The Lexar Media 1GB SD Card SD1GB -32-231, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card.  Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available.  A 1000MB card should be an investment.  You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity.  Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted.  Then what do you do?

But for those of us who've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest iPod (I think the latest version is down to a quantum-level size device), this is a solid player for that purpose.

Generally, this is a good product, though there are a couple of drawbacks.First, the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries.  This seems kind of silly given that remotes aren't exactly power hogs.  Now, this could simply be a quirk of mine, and may not be a feature of the product overall, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one, so I've decided to live with this (it's not often it'll be on pure battery mode).The other minor complaint is that it's not possible to fast-forward within an MP3 track when playing an MP3 CD (regular CD's can fastforward within a track).  Not sure why it doesn't, since every other MP3 CD player I've come across does (discman, car MP3 CD player, etc.), but it's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view.The sound equalizer is very minimal, but truthfully I wasn't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall, and things in-between.

Within minutes, I was already capturing my very first video. This unit works very nicely with retail VHS tapes (I found that it does not respond to Macrovision, though I only tested one tape), home movies, and off-air master tapes (tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts). At first, I captured a short promotional music video at 8 Mb\\/s in a resolution of 720x480. This produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape. There are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer, but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen.Then I captured a longer home movie, which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a single-layer DVD. My original bitrate of 8 Mb\\/s was too high, and the higher bitrate wasn't really helping the video quality too much. But if my bitrate is too low, the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a TV. Perform a google search for \\\"videohelp bitrate calculator\\\" and click on the Videohelp bitrate calculator link. I use the calculator to figure out what bitrate I should capture in, according to the total time of all the programs I want to put on DVD. Below 7 Mb\\/s seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback, but it's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies.After capturing this longer movie, I found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot. Now, whenever I operate it, I point a small fan at it, and this seems to keep it cool and running well. But keeping the unit cool shouldn't be the user's responsibility, so it loses points for temperature.While this device works well if the input video has a stable picture, a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss (being copied several times). I tried capturing one of these tapes, which was of a TV show from 1993, and the DVD Xpress did not handle it very well. The result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory. I am disappointed with this.On the other hand, I have a tape that was recorded from TV in 1988. It is the master copy, so there is no generational loss. DVD Xpress was able to capture it just fine.Not once during any of my captures did audio  video get out of sync, so credit where credit's due to ADS Tech for that.After a few days of experimenting with this capture device, I definitely want to keep it. I look forward to finally being able to clean out my VHS closet.My recommendations to other buyers: Understand your source, and you won't be disappointed.

What more is there to say\"},\"183\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"How good an alarm clock is basically comes down to this: When you set the alarm with the three or four settings you need to do--alarm on\\/off, radio\\/CD\\/annoying noise,volume, and in this case the track you want it to play or if you want it on shuffle or not--does it actually do what you specified the settings to do.  The Sony Dream Machine does, and it features two equally accessible alarms as well so that husband and wife (or husband and husband or wife and wife as the case may be) don't need to argue over how to set the alarm for two morning schedules, along with convenient and easy to understand buttons for the radio presets and cd player controls. IMPORTANT NOTE: The two alarm settings are completely independent of each other, so one person can wake up to a CD and the other to a favorite radio station if they like.  My wife is from Japan for instance, and she wants a Japanese pop CD in there, while I'm partial to waking up to NPR news.Best Feature--The Snooze button: It can be pressed multiple times at a shot to set how much time thereafter you want it to make another attempt at waking you, up to an hour later; and it's generously sized so that you can find it easily when you're not quite all there yet.Worst Feature--the lack of any sort of backup battery.  For this price, they should just put in a long term one like computers have--providing just enough power to startup the system and remember settings.  I'm pretty sure a battery like the one Sony features in my video camera (circa 1998, TR3000 bought in Japan) would do the trick while only needing very periodic replacement.Sound--good, not excellent, but it's an alarm clock, not a stereo.  For a kid's room or for your general purpose needs, the sound quality is plenty good.  No one needs 100 watts per channel, crystal clear sound to wake up to in the morning, and this little appliance does an exceptional job of serving both as an alarm clock and a handy, space-saving and attractive stereo.  It's perfect for not only the bedroom, but the kitchen as well.  For the performance to price ratio, you could only do better by blowing the wad for a Bose unit.Not for great-grandma: Younger grandparent-age people will probably be fine with it--say, as a gift--but if they're from the WWII generation or earlier, forget about it; in fact, forget anything with buttons or digital displays. Sony makes really excellent clock radios with the same reliable analogue features your grandparents have come to enjoy growing up but much improved, and they'll appreciate the thoughtfulness of such a gift much better--while this thing would just gather dust somewhere and be an entire waste of money or source of annoyance.If I had to remark on one real downside to this unit, it's that the backlight really is too bright to sleep with it pointing at your face--and be close enough to reach without getting up--while being on a setting that is readable when you're still bleary-eyed.  Add that the control for the brightness is not conveniently located (it's on the back) so you couldn't just reach over in your half-coma state, brighten it, then turn it back down.  They should have added a feature like outdoor electronics have--such as cycling computers and GPS units--where you can press a button, it lights up for a moment, then goes back to it's preset brightness.BOTTOM LINE: The best, most reliable, and enjoyable alarm clock I've ever owned.  It's durable, easy to clean, looks nice, and features two utterly independent alarm settings--so you'll only need one--in addition to generous preset buttons and easy controls.  It's really worth just exactly what Amazon is charging for it\"},\"184\":{\"category\":\"electronics\",\"text\":\"I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.

Now if I want to take a nap I don't have to mess with setting one of the alarms.  I just push one button several times and it's all set.  I would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone.I use the extendable snooze occasionally, but I don't know if there is a point at which it no longer works -- some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze -- this makes it unusable for me because I don't trust myself knowing that when I am half asleep!Sound quality is great, I like how you can set the track of the CD and how loud it should be.

I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest\\/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain\\/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice.

Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted\\/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control).

No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time.

I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room.The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output.

In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money.WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...?It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately.

After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer.

Unfortunately, this was not \\\"too close for comfort\\\" as far as the dog was concerned.Having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices, I was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working.  Alas, it did not.  Some dogs just don't hear them.  In my case, it was probably due at least in part to the distance.My suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target.  If it doesn't work, go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what I did).  By the way, you don't need an RA (AKA RMA) number to return the device.

The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do.

I had read several reviews either really good or really bad so I was quite skeptical, but my dog (jack russell terrier) would bark at the rays of sunlight coming into the house, so I was desperate.The most important thing to remember when buying a product like this is that there aren't many things that are both great and easy. When you buy treats for dog to train him, do you simply leave the treats out all the time. No. Because he would never figure out that the treats were a reward for doing what you wanted him to. It's the same thing with the bark stop.The first thing you should do with this device is put it to the audible setting and then test and see what makes the bark stop actually go off. I found that doors shutting hard, clanging dishes, etc all set it off. So, if the device goes off every 5 seconds, the dog isn't going to think for a second that it's going off because he's barking. He's going to assume that it's a uncontrollable sound that he has to live with.So after putting the device back into the ultrasonic sound setting, I decided that I would only plug the device in when the dog was barking or when he was in his cage. Also, I never leave the device plugged in when I'm doing dishes slamming doors, or doing loud things. So the dog only hears the device when he barks. I realize that this might be a slight annoyance to walk on egg shells in order to make sure the device works, but I would rather do that than have a barking dog. The way I look at it, is I wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats in the middle of his training, so why leave it plugged in all the time.In the end, the first time I plugged in the bark stop, I let the dog bark it out. He barked for about 5 minutes (normally 10-15) and then stopped. The second time I plugged it in, he didn't bark more than twice. The bark stop puts out a ultrasonic beep when you plug it in, so I think that now he knows when he's going to hear more than he wants to. I think that the dog has now gotten more used to it, and will try to out bark it, but for the most part, he doesn't bark much at all while it's on, if he barks at all. The one thing that the manual does say is that if the dog is trying to protect the house, usually this device won't help, which I think is a good thing.Cons:When I was testing the microphone (used for taking in the bark loudness) on the device, it didn't seem to matter if the microphone was on high or low. Also, this device would be so much more useful if it came with a remote to turn on or off, not to manage each bark, but to simply be able to sit at the couch and click it on, or to click it off\"},\"309\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"The item didn't work at all.

I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer. The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs\\/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.

And, because of the \\\"flip it\\\" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the \\\"dirty water\\\" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.

Since that time we have fried okra, french fries, tater tots, onion petals, cheese sticks and even did fried ice cream.  All have turned out very well.  It holds a little shy of 1 gallon of oil.  This heats up in about 10 minutes.  There is an indicator light to let one know when it is up to temperature.  Once frozen food is put in the oil quickly comes back up to temperature.

This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect.This is my third (and final) bread machine. The first two were Breadman Ultimates. I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average, pretty much every morning.The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. This was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond).I bought an new Breadman Ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. This time I took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down, no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed, making the machine useless. Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman.At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one.Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect.I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate:1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much.2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense.3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs.4) The programmability options are very limited:- You can't control the knockdown time between risings.- You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings.- You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle.- When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones. - And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a \\\"safety feature\\\" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion.For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations.At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology. All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination.A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution.I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology.

Fast and delicious carrot juice in my own kitchen!  Clean-up was easy (well, I was an old pro by now) and quick--under five minutes.     To address some of the negatives you may read, first, size:  of course it's big.  They're all big and bulky.  It's their nature.  Second, residue:  my carrot pulp was DRY.  I suppose if I'd put it on the floor and stood on it I might have gotten maybe another teaspoon of carrot juice out of it.  Third, it's factory reconditioned:  for me, that's a plus.  Consider this:  the manufacturer rolls out tens of thousands of these off the line, each one eye-balled and polished by QC before bagging and boxing, assuming that they are all good to go.  But, a factory re-con is gone over from top to bottem, inside and out before it's released.  No assumptions--the last thing the manufacturer wants is to see that thing back again, so you know they'll make sure they don't.  And if it'd been returned for a little cosmetic blem, I can certainly live with that considering the discount I'm getting.   I'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away, but Waring is an old and trusted brand, and the juicer is not cheaply made.

The unit - while not as powerful as more expensive models, I'm sure - juiced up everything with no hesitation.

There are basically three main parts to remove and it takes all of thirty-seconds. No problem.If there's one thing I could change, it would be a better designed pulp-catcher that would allow a bag to be used.

Plus I guess it will deplete the batteries much faster than just the pedometer function. I do not know if the other device of the same company with the calorie meter uses the same mechanism, but probably it would be more practical and for the same price provide something more.In conclusion, this device has a good price for what it gives, although there are accurate pedometers with less money that someone can buy, but definately do not seem as sturdy. Personally I like this device a lot and I highly recommend it (pending of course to see how long it will last as well as how long it takes to change batteries)\"},\"457\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"If you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment, this isn't for you.

The sound is \\\"tinny\\\"; it's NOT stereo; there's NO frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size!

I saw it at a boat show and tried some. My husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I really love it. I love the decaf house blend. It is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf. Decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it.The Flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee. I also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well. I like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks.It surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research BEFORE buying it. It is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee. The Flavia is a luxury item, not for a poor working stiff. Anyway, the Flavia is fast and simple and convenient. In fact, I'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now. Enjoy it\"},\"462\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"I absolutely love this machine!  The selection of coffees and teas is wonderful.  I am a tea drinker, primarily Engish Breakfast and Chai latte, and I am quite picky about the quality.  With some of the pod brewers I have tried, the tea has been quite weak.  However with the Flavia, the Engish Breakfast tea is very good.  The Chai is excellent as well.  The Chai latte is very smooth and doesn't have the peppery taste that some can have.  Pros: 1. Great tasting coffees and teas      2. Great selection      3. Virtually no clean up      4. You can brew a cup of tea after making coffee and the tea doesn't           taste like coffee (very important)Cons: 1. You better make sure the bottom of the brewer is flush with the                top of the cup or it will blow whatever you are brewing all over you and your kitchen.  This will only happen once, trust me, because you will not want this to happen again.      2. You can only purchase coffees and teas through their website.

HINT. get the Vanilla Syrup pack and add it in the mix\"},\"464\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"We have bought several coffee makers over the past few years seeking the elusive cup of coffee house quality coffee. At long last, it has arrived in the form of the Flavia Fusion! This is the easiest, quickest, most delicious cup of home brewed coffee or tea you will ever make. The unit does have a large footprint, but it definitely fits on the counter without taking up too much room if you have an average sized kitchen or larger. Set up is simple - remove from box, insert the filter, fill it with water and plug it in. Thats it. Once you \\\"prime\\\" the system (pressing two buttons on the top while simultaneously flipping the power switch)you're ready to go. Insert the beverage packet, adjust the height to accommodate your drinking vessel, push the button and voila! Since the water is preheated you get a hot, delicious beverage of choice in 30 seconds. If you get the \\\"medley\\\" pack (value $29.99)you also get a free travel mug. Contrary so what some reviewers have said, it DOES fit in the unit when you remove the drip tray. The medley pack is a nice extra as it gives you the opportunity to taste test every flavor being investing in a large purchase and finding out you don't like it. The \\\"creamy topping\\\" is a must have for any special \\\"indulgence\\\" drinks you want, a necessity for the exotic chai if you want it to taste just like Starbucks, which it does. This is a fantastic time saver in the morning, and when you have guests its terrific to be able to make a different flavor for each person. As for clean up, there are two words..\\\"what cleanup?\\\". You take the package out of the machine and throw it in the garbage, simple as that. No more filters to buy, no more pots to descale, no more throwing out half of the pot that you didn't drink. Just amazing.\"},\"465\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"This machine is wonderful! I first tried Flavia coffee a couple of years ago while waiting for my car to be serviced at the Mercedes dealership. Best coffee I'd had in a long time. It's so nice to walk into the kitchen, insert a packet and push a button for a cup of hot......whatever I feel like! This machine deserves a five rating in the ease of use and the flavor of the packets, whether they are teas, coffee or chocolate. I would recommend this to anyone\"},\"466\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"I love this machine. Each package is its own brewing system. That means that there is nothing to clean, nothing to clog, and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other. I love strong coffee and I found even the House Brand to be full flavored. Most surprising is how good the teas taste. You actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea. The herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor. The only disappointment was the hot chocolate: It was basically just as good as Swiss Miss. The frothing packages do work, but I get just as good if not better from skim milk and a $2 gizmo from IKEA. They are nice to keep on hand. The Milky Way froth does give a nice caramel flavor. The big down side is you can only get refills from Flavia. They have recently started giving free shipping on orders over $100, so stock up and get the free shipping. My big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir: I have accidentially run out of water more than once. The machine does 'spit' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup\"},\"467\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"I have the black Fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room), and my wife and I already love this machine.  We have tried all sorts of mixes, and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do.  This is one of the first times I've been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it.Physical properties: It handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray, which is largely unneeded anyway), and all our \\\"standard\\\" mugs.  The drink head moves up and down, so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with \\\"frothy\\\" drinks than coffee and tea).  When it brews a filterpack, it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and, thus, keep it from dripping as you remove it).  The water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long), but if you have a ready source of water nearby, it shouldn't be a problem.  The tank fits better and slides on easier than the Senseo (which we also have).Flavor-wise: It's made by M\\/Mars, so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called Indulgence fare) is excellent.  Coffee blends are quite good, especially the darker roasts like \\\"French Roast\\\" and \\\"Sumatra\\\".  Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks, moreso than other chains.Clean-up: Wipe the inside of the drink head, and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly \\\"splashy\\\" drinks.  No need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine, especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug.  Of course, you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low, so your first few times, you'll probably get a drip here and there.Final bits: We've had the Senseo since its launch.  Between pods that need \\\"pre-wetting\\\" to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks, the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia.  We drink coffee, tea, espresso drinks, mixed blends, and sweet-tooth-friendly \\\"indulgence\\\" mixes every day with the Flavia, and it's brain-dead-easy to use.  Certainly easier to clean up after, too!  If you're on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings (like Senseo), get the Flavia.  Keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the Flavia.    I'm sipping a lemon\\/blueberry tea blend now, made over ice, and it's fantastic.  Highly recommended\"},\"468\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee.That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives\"},\"469\":{\"category\":\"kitchen_houseware\",\"text\":\"Granted, it is a bit noisy at first (more like a shocking sound, not so much noisy), but you get used to it.  The mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill, especially if you've never used any of the larger office machines.  This was a complete first for me.  I mixed a few, watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes, but I got the hang of it and love it.  I commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at $2 to $3 a cup, so there's a huge savings in this product.  And the tea is the best I've ever had.  They actually add juice concentrates in the pack (some selections), so the tea is very flavorable.  The machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter, but I think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home.  It will always stick out at first.  I bought black and it looks great.  There really isn't any cleanup at all.  Other machines I looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons.  This really is so simple.  Finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter.  Because the packs are bigger than most pods, it is a challenge.  I ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry.  The round display rack that Flavia offers looks pretty neat.  I will definately buy that.

When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.    Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.

Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious  saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.Finally, it should be noted that the producers\\/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.Still and all, the film is very watchable.

(No, I won't give it away, even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is, but if you don't know, be careful about reading any farther.) What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful  experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding.

And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.

As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like \\\"Hostel\\\" and those damned \\\"Saw\\\" movies (enough, already)! At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly.

Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like \\\"The Exorcist\\\" - if that's what you want, buy and watch \\\"The Exorcist\\\".

Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the \\\"Ocean of Fire\\\" in the 1890's.This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver.  The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a \\\"cowboy'.  We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke.  And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American.  This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins.Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world.  When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life.Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity.  Viggo must have definitely \\\"lived\\\" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them.  He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing.  Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series.  This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance.  Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover.\"},\"529\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action\\/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the \\\"Ocean of Fire\\\".Highly Recommended\"},\"530\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.  In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!

I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up\"},\"531\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character.  Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant.  What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted.Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider.  He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years.  After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East.A side note.  The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre.  The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank.  I will discuss these distractions more later in this review.This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins.  Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race.  Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race.  Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts.  He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger.  Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining.The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo.  Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character.  Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie.  Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie.The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions.  I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race.  Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were.  I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring.  Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions.  The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly.I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins.  Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest.\"},\"532\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.

At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade \\\"Miss Congeniality\\\" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison.

Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you.      A Time to kill's plot is pretty simply explained.  In the deep south, a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks, who almost kill her. A young white lawyer and father (Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance) is sickened at the news, and doesn't quite know what to think when the little girl's father (Sammuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey) pays him a visit and asks if he'd \\\"help him if he were in a tight spot\\\".  The next day as the two redneck\\/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment, Carl Lee Hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher.     Jake Brigance agrees to defend Hailey as his murder trial begins. The insanity plea is used to \\\"give the jury an excuse to aquit\\\" But in my opinion, I think it was quite legitimate. What father WOULDN't be driven insane under the circumstances?  the rest of the movie is Carl Lee Hailey's trial and the surrounding Drama as KKK violence emerges led by Kiefer Sutherland, and Jake's life and home are in danger, his relationship with his wife strained, and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle.        My favorite scene? It might come as a surprise, but my favorite scene is when the Prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial. He was caught in the knee by a stray bullet, and now has half a leg.  After the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against Carl Lee, and establish unerring identity of the shooter, The Defence asks him two questions. \\\"Do you think Carl Lee intentionally shot you?\\\" \\\"No\\\" \\\"Do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did?\\\"\\\"He did what I would have done.\\\"but it doesn't end there as the Policeman (remember he's missing a leg because of what Carl Lee Hailey Did) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like Carl Lee did. He starts screaming to the jury to \\\"turn him loose, He's a hero!\\\"  I think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes (albeit there are many others too) (Great acting by Chris Cooper as the policeman) Anyway.. forgive if I rambled.

Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled \\\"drink me\\\" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing \\\"Alice in Wonderland\\\" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches \\\"Fantasia\\\" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!\"},\"567\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorite animated films.

Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind.

So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie.Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water.

She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit.Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down.This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different.

Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me???? \"},\"584\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"Yes, it is that funny.  The humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP, in which Christopher Guest costarred, and predecessor to Guest's later masterpieces BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND.  Reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre, in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary.  Guest has in three films now masterfully emulated Reiner's style, assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again.  Almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three.Unless one prefers dumbed-down slapstick, this is comedy just about as funny as it comes.  The first time I saw it I don't think I really caught on until the scene where Blaine, Missouri's (the film was actually filmed in Texas) town historian recounted how Blaine was founded after wagon train leader Blaine Fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in California near the Pacific when in fact they were in Missouri.  The plot is rather simple.  In honor of the 150th anniversary of Blaine's inadvertent founding, a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue.  Corky St. Clair, an obviously gay theater person who has fled New York for the small town, takes on the challenge of directing.  The bulk of the movie consists of auditions, rehearsals, and the final performance of the musical.  The title stems from the hope that a Mr. Guffman of a New York theatrical company will be in attendance.  This film was literally made up as they went along.  My understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which Guest had to craft a final film.  While move films are refined in the editing phase, this one is unique for being created at that stage.  Because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll, a film like this takes a special cast of actors.  Veterans of improv like Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy and stand ups such as Fred Willard are to be expected, but what is so great is how people you wouldn't automatically think would excel in the form, such as the always delightful Parker Posey, do so.  By way of trivia, the part of the play's narrator is played by Lewis Arquette, son of Cliff Arquette and father of all those other Arquettes, including Rosanna, Patricia, and David.  And I'm sure all ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fans will love the UFO expert, played by none other than Tobias himself, David Cross (famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show).One of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a \\\"Three Months Later\\\" coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up.  Corky is back in New York, hoping for tryouts (perhaps as Henry Higgins in a revival of MY FAIR LADY).  The joke comes when we find out he is running a Hollywood memorabilia store, where one of the hottest items is a MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action figure set.  For those who haven't seen the film, the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is Wallace and Andre talk while seated in a restaurant.I've learned the hard way that this and Guest's other films aren't for everybody.  Not everyone seems to \\\"get\\\" them.  This astonishes me since I find these films funnier than anything else coming out of Hollywood these days.  But for whatever reason, so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them.  But for those who are, these films are priceless gems\"},\"585\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"Apparently this is one of those \\\"cult\\\" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits. \\\"Waiting for Guffman\\\" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the \\\"funniest movie ever\\\" or \\\"hilarious\\\" is definitely out of the mainstream.I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv\\/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS.

He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.

Slickly, but sharply presented, it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that can't fail to enthrall a NYSE broker or an unfamiliar novice.  The elements are assembled expertly by 'Survivor' creator, Mark Burnett, and The Donald.  Editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success, but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama.  Alumni Bill Rancic in his autobiographical business memoir, called 'The Apprentice,' a game show.  Deference should be showed for his evaluation, but they could have fooled us.  It seems more like a simulation.  Season one comes together serendipitously for three reasons:  the task, taskmaster, and the takers.  Mystery pervades every episode with a colorful group of contestants, an assignment with a different business aspect provided, and an elimination round that is suspenseful and skillfully prepared.  (What will they have to do?  How will they get their act together?  Who will get fired?)  Then, in the middle of the episode, The Donald has a cameo appearance where he expounds on the business lesson or principal, usually highlighting a contestant's later actions.  It could have come across as a schmaltzy business lesson, but his folksy, no-nonsense lecture becomes an illuminating intermission.  Season one works well for the cast of characters.  (And, as contestants, there are plenty here!)  The first season was not just successful because of viewer curiosity, it worked because the first group had less talent and accumen and more heart and colorful personalities overall.  There was a savvy, charismatic businesswoman from Texas (Amy), a colorful cowboy from Boise (Troy), a brash, but spunky New Yorker (Heidi), a smooth and learned broker (Kwame), and a calm and hard-working entrepreneur from Chicago (Bill) just to name a few.  The serial drama seems genuine and not forced.  (The premise contained risks that could have been a disaster.)  The plot thickened with alliances that were made and broken, but more interesting was the love interest of Amy and Nick.  Both the couple and the producers captured the relationship in a way to keep it from overtaking the main story, but the presentation kept us guessing whether it was genuine love or a ploy at office politics.  Furthermore, a villain was added to the mix.  Omarossa Manigault-Stallworth--forgive me for the misspelling!--formerly worked for the Clinton administration and had the political skills to throw a wrench into everything.  She wasn't rationalizing when she said she was way too creative to take a job with Donald Trump.  On 'The Apprentice' website, she wrote that never was so much good come from being so bad.  (It turns out that she's had the most follow-up stories.  An aspiring actress, she's been successful for Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' and a UPN soap opera.  Maybe she was grooming to be the next Erica Caine\\/Susan Lucci all along.  In a recent book, Trump himself called her \\\"the most articulate\\\" of all the first year contestants.  I thought the same, but have to give him the credit.)  Not to spoil discoveries with details, but Nick's honesty and chauvenism, Amy's perfectionism, and Heidi's family drama are just a few developments added to keep our interest. Seldom have people on a reality show been more endearing than with this ensemble.   Upon the debut, we all became armchair quarterbacks, calling them out for dumb plays and wrongly calling out the Donald for some executive decisions.  (When he fired Omarossa, I thought he did it at the worst time, when she was at her finest form and the only one on her team to produce.  However, results are everything.  He didn't get to be a billionaire for bad judgment!  To rephrase 'SNL', \\\"He's The Donald.  And You're NOT!\\\")   And, that's where the success falls apart.  Sam correctly distinguished the difference between good candidacy and good television with his 'Apprentice' website commentary.  To paraphrase, a good strategy and engaging television can often come at cross-purposes.  True to himself, after season one Donald Trump showcased bigger clients with bigger prizes and candidates with far better resumes.  The result was a feeding frenzy.  Later seasons fostered business accumen like never before and aspiring starlets mugging for the camera.  The professionals devoured the latter.  Stacy J., for instance, was unfairly eliminated early and accused of lunacy for her vibrant, cheerleading sensibilities.  If the catclaws were apparent season one, they at least managed to put them away in time to win against the men!  Season two was bloody.  After season one the tasks were bigger but didn't showcase specific designated skills (like negotiating) for each week with each new task.  The later simulations often failed to surprise.  Later, it was harder to like the candidates.  Trump's admirable genuineness created, but later killed, the show.       \"},\"602\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"I Live in Thailand  I Dont get any American TV Programs Here so I watch a lot of TV Shows on DVD I either get from friends or buy on-line.

It is his style and strong characterization as Lawrence Jamieson that holds the film together and allows Steve Martin to riff with his role as the crass Freddie Benson.  The film takes some chances and not everything works and some of it seems as if it belongs in another film, but part of the key to this film is to distract you so you don't really suspect what is happening until the end.Glenne Headly is very nice as Janet Colgate, the object of a bet between the over confident con men.  Lawrence and Freddie are so sure of themselves that the loser is willing to leave town because each believes the other one is the loser.  However, Caine's character, Jamieson, begins to have pangs about treating such an innocent so callously.  Freddie, Steve Martin's more crass con man, has his own misgivings, as well.  There are several really well done supporting roles, but the movie is really about these three and how Caine and Martin begin working together and end up competing.  One of the finest bits in the movie is when Caine is trying to teach Martin the social graces of a gentleman con man.  Frank Oz did a good job with this movie.  Some might say that he let too much of Martin's shtick into the movie, but I think it serves its important purpose of misdirection.  And much as Jim Carrey today, Martin was quite hot then and audiences had certain expectations for him.  And the bits are funny in a way that also induces a bit of queasiness, but funny nonetheless.Watching the movie nowadays, while I still enjoy Martin's performance, I really enjoy Caine's more and notice Headly a bit more than I did the first time through\"},\"614\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"This is outright hilarious.

It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience.Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama.Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor.Such show quality makes \\\"ER - The Complete First Two Seasons\\\" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future\"},\"627\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"The Crow (Collector's Series Boxed Set) consists of the first three of four in the series.

Brandon Lee's performance will become (if not already) legendary, and I refer to his DVD interview to emphasis its greatness (\\\"because we do not know when we will die, we think of life as an inexhaustable well\\\" will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it).These three are classics, not to be confused with the fourth, which has less impact, since it tries too hard to be original, yet looses something along the way in terms of casting, acting, and cinematography, as the desert-themed atmosphere hasn't worked that well. Should have used more of that \\\"grittier\\\" feel to the scenes (like the four horsemen's introduction scenes), if you ask me. Having read Poppy Z.

I have a number of versions of the CROW on VHS and DVD, and the Extras on the triple pack fail in one respect; there is an interview with Lee on the VHS version that is without a doubt, one of the most poignant, touching, and eerily prescient interviews on tape. Lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless, and yet... how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious... it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment, but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now , because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment, we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant. And just the loss ,the loss , or at least the change, of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the DVD.However, the triple  pack is well worth it, if only to get the brilliant film, and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original THE CROW, and the sequels should never have been made...

Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls. Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it\"},\"655\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme.

While this was panned by critics, it spoke to something in the audience in it's sociopathic tendencies.Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, the student body president of an elitist New York boarding school and step sister of Ryan Phillipe, the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser.  She makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed Reese Witherspoon, who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage.  Should he succeed, he can have Kathryn.  If he fails, Kathryn can have his car.Perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel, but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves.  Just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what I mean.  Ryan Phillipe is every girl's dream come true and worst nightmare.  While he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can, he will post nude photos of them on the Internet and pat himself on the back as a stud.  Give him a challenge, such as Reese Witherspoon, and he has to work hard for it.  While he is truly a cad, he does in the end feel love for Reese because he had to work for her affections.  Kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no, as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions.  Listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom, that's what it's all about.  As the viewer, you can't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes.  How about that scene when Kathryn says she puts her trust in Jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon?  That's classic.  If anything it teaches you to not fall for others' fronts.

These two movies were\\\"Wild Things\\\" and \\\"Cruel Intentions\\\". While \\\"Wild Things\\\" featured an elaborate plot, all-star cast, great sex scenes; \\\"Cruel Intentions\\\" plot is simple, has a cast of then up-and-comers, and has no nudity at all.Both of these movies scored with the MTV crowd and while you can find both films in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart, everyone remembers them. Also, both of these movies are just mindless fun; You're attention span doesn't have to be large and the people involved in both movies weren't trying to make classic films that would win Oscars and great acclaim, which in the long run attracted many critics and audiences to these movies.

Sebastian is a spoiled rich kid, who happens to be incredibly charming and takes pleasure in having sex with young women and destroying their lives. Everyone knows what Sebastian is like, and he loves it. His step-sister Kathryn is pretty much the same, except she basks in the role of the \\\"good-girl\\\", she's even student body president of the school they attend.

Sebastian has found something a bit more interesting...The new headmaster's daughter Annette (Reese Witherspoon). Annette is a virgin, who plans to stay that way and Sebastian sees a challenge. So, Kathryn proposes a wager. If Sebastian succeeds in deflowering Annette, he will get the thing he's been longing for, for years. He'll get to bed Kathryn. If he loses, Kathryn gets his most prized possession...His car. Pit of a perverted plot yes and it comes together in funny, sometimes even stupid ways. But, as I said earlier for mindless entertainment it's dead on. As for the performances, Gellar is great as the sadistic little nice girl. With Phillippe, however, I couldn't tell if his acting was bad or if that's how Sebastian would act. Blair captures the innocent, unwitting virgin girl quality perfectly.  She's so good in fact, she almost seems to be a virgin. Witherspoon (obviously, since she's the only person in this film to go and win anything) in really the strongpoint of the film. At this point in her career she really had the cute innocent girl face and qualities, and there's a few scenes in the movie where the \\\"face\\\" thing I mentioned is clearly there; but she's playing a different virgin girl from Blair. Witherspoon is playing the knowing, smart, want to wait for love girl. So, this movie is really not for everybody as you may have figured out by now. But if you're at the video store and just need 90 minutes of entertainment and fun, go for it. GRADE: B\"},\"659\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart. But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin\"},\"660\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"I'm glad this is finally available on DVD - I've just about worn out my old VHS version of it.  On this DVD you get an introduction by Kathy, followed by a warm-up routine.  This is composed of some light aerobics and stretching.  Then you get five different ab workouts, one for each day of the week.  They each last about 10 - 12 minutes (I never actually timed them, but it seems like they get progressively longer from the first to the last).  Each workout consists of approximately five different exercises, though there may be two or three variations on an exercise, so there's quite a bit of variety.  Areas targeted are upper and lower abs and obliques (the muscles along the sides of the abs).  The Monday workout is fairly easy and shouldn't present a problem for any but the most out-of-shape individuals.  Tuesday's workout is only slightly harder.  By the time you get to Wednesday and Thursday, they start getting rather challenging.  To get through these you'll need to be in fairly descent shape.  Friday is the really difficult one, I'd say a person would have to be in excellent shape to complete it.Of course, you can just stop and take a short rest if the exercises get to hard for you, then join back in.  It took me about six weeks before I was able to complete the Friday workout all the way through without taking a few little breaks.  I like to use this video as a warm-up before my weight lifting workout.  Kathy does the workout along with 5 other people.  The music is unobtrusive synth-pop type stuff with a little funk edge to it.  You'll need a bench (or chair) and some dumbells (only used on two exercises, you could use some other object if you don't have dumbells).I'd recommend this tape for the moderately fit individual looking to get into even better shape.  You'll definitely get a six-pack from doing these workouts, provided that your body fat percentage is low enough that you can see your abs\"},\"661\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"This movie is hilarious, and it also delivers powerful truths about the workplace.

Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart \\\"fantasy-revenge\\\" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience. We need to salute Director\\/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for \\\"Harold and Maude\\\", \\\"Silver Streak\\\" and \\\"Foul Play\\\", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for \\\"Foul Play\\\" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited \\\"Ground Hogs Day\\\", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping \\\"9 to 5\\\" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for \\\"Best Editing\\\" for; \\\"Tora! Tora!Tora!\\\", 1970, \\\"Bound For Glory\\\",1976, \\\"Out Of Africa\\\", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and \\\"9 to 5\\\" is one of them. The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three \\\"innocent women\\\" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an \\\"Oscar\\\", \\\"Best Song\\\", and 3 \\\"Golden Globes\\\", includeing \\\"Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy\\\". This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is \\\"his\\\" 3 \\\"GIRLS\\\" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in \\\"All In The Family\\\" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and \\\"9 to 5\\\" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you. My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as \\\"Snow White\\\" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more. The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved. This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. \\\"REEL JUSTICE\\\", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated. --* THE CAST --* Colin Higgins  - Director \\/ Screenwriter Jane Fonda  - Judy Bernly Lily Tomlin  - Violet Newstead Dolly Parton  - Doralee Rhodes Dabney Coleman  - Franklin Hart Jr. Sterling Hayden  - Tinsworthy Elizabeth Wilson  - Roz Henry Jones  - Hinkle Lawrence Pressman  - Dick Marian Mercer  - Missy Hart  --* THE AWARDS --*Best Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Academy   Best Actress- Musical or Comedy (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe   Best Original Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe   New Star of the Year - Female (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe  DVD FEATURES: It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release.

However, their are some strong messages here that can be well learned.  Bosses should not verbally abuse and\\/or sexually intent, touch, harass any employee.

She is ready for a promotion. She trains Judy on her first day.  In fact, Violet has trained most of the people there and they have been promoted instead of her.  Dolly Parton (in her first film) is \\\"Doralee Rhodes\\\".  Mr. Hart's main secretary.  There is bad gossip going around about the boss and the secretary, but it is not true.  Doralee is a married woman  and is a Christian and pure as Judy is and would never engage in bad behavior at work.  Dabney Coleman is the boss, \\\"Franklin Hart\\\". He is the boss and the vice-president.  Has has a bad mouth towards secretaries and wants \\\"personal servitude\\\" that is not part of the job description.  After the boss makes personal advances towards Doralee, makes inappropriate comments towards Violet and dismisses Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) for having light conversation in the bathroom and guessing the bosses salary, and after another incident, Violet, along with Doralee and Judy later decide that something has to be done to the boss and improvements must be made within the company.  Better working conditions for all.  Violet just might get her promotion yet.Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson, Peggy Pope, Sterling Hayden, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer.

It features some of the best Russian actors that we love seeing and acting; they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well. If you are a tough judge of movies, then please make sure you know Soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in American movies before you call it crap. I do not see why there should be a problem with characters not talking for the first ten minutes of the movie. In fact, it is just a few minutes during which you are shown the premise of the movie. And as for cyrillic letters not making sense: this is a Russian movie and you are bound to see everything written in our gibberish alphabet. Besides, the movie begins with a cruise in a foreign country (it was shot in Baku, Azerbajan but is supposed to be Turkey). The language spoken by the locals as well as the signs on buildings are gibberish - it was made up specially for the movie.That said, I want to say a few words about the plot. Semen Semenovich is a diligent Russian economist goes on a cruise, where he gets acquainted with a mafia mob's right hand, Kozodoev, whose assignment is to pick up diamonds from the supplier and deliver it back to Moscow via a cast on his arm. During one of the last stops, Semen Semenovich gets mistaken for Kozodoev and ends up with a cast and jewels inside it. As he returns to Moscow, Semen contacts the police. Now, he has to pose as bait and escape the traps elaborately planted by the mafia.As I already said, the movie is fantastic. Just remember that it is a farce. And no, there is not slapstick humour.

The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. \\\"Eight Women\\\" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2\\/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun.

Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song.

While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.By the 2\\/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars.

As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais. Deneuve, Bart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in.What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes!The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry.

Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek \\\"who done its\\\" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death.Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country.  Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion.  While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about.The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties.  (Note Suzon's pink\\/orange pony skirt.)  To quote a line from the film, \\\"it's a sad family affair\\\" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight.  Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film.  Strange.In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs.Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered.

Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid.  Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law.

This docutainment is the story about Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, the fall guy, Falstow (the CFO) who would be left to hang to dry and their doings that would have such a detrimental impact on so many people.

But, once the overall story had been discussed, this documentary did a fairly good job of telling a compelling narrative and trying to explain the rather complicated financial wizardry that was ultimately the corporation's downfall. The depictions of Skilling were very clear and it was nice to see a woman was at the heart of breaking the story and writing the movie (which was based on a book she co-wrote). Amusing use of music and title-cards kept the pace quick, and unlike Michael Moore's documentaries, this one was actually full of well presented facts.

Skilling knew that the company was facing severe trouble if it were found that they were tampering with numbers and taking millions from the corporation. Enron fell hard like the World Trade Center when it was reported that its earnings were dropping like flies and bankruptcy was the ultimate demise.The documentary explores the dark side of humans.

No one should be scared not to invest in the stock market. But always be careful and alert as to how this company is operating\"},\"701\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"At first, I wasn't too keen on seeing this movie- Its title, ENRON-THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM- suggested to me that it would be about a bunch of smart guys number crunching on their way to faking accounting records.  What else would a bunch of 'smart guys' do?Well, certainly the Enron executives did this.  The film explains in easy to understand terms how Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling demanded the use of 'Mark to Marketing' - an accounting scheme allowing him to post 'future profits' of an new idea immediately (ie, if an idea of inventing a new spaceship design is expected to reap a billion dollars in the future, one could post the profits now, never mind that the ship may never get built, if built may not work as envisioned, or people may loose interest in space, and so on.) Of course, such profits were not 'real' but nicely balanced off Enron's actual massive losses.  Also balancing off Enron's massive losses were the fake companies created by Andy Fastow, which he used to bury Enron's enormous debts- and in the meantime, pocketed millions for himself.But while shady accounting schemes may explain the technical, proximate causes of the fall of Enron, it is not the ultimate explanation.  The ultimate reason why Enron fell is pure, naked, ugly- and all to human- Greed.   And this is what the film portrays, and does so brilliantly, with insider footage showing 'Enron skits' and meetings, and recordings of conversations and deals being made in the trading floor.We get to see Jeff Skilling in a skit in which he snickers and mocks his own accounting strategy, stating \\\"...we can add a kazillion dollars to the bottom line.\\\"  We see Andy Fastow in an insider video, with a sly grin on his face, explaining to greedy bankers (all the big guns like Citibank, Deutsche Bank, etc) his scheme to be the CFO of both his shell company LJM and Enron.  Never mind any conflict of interest, as he will always be on 'LJM's side of the transaction\\\" (netting both him and the greedy bankers money at the expense of Enron). Even worse was the greedy, cut throat culture that developed among Enron traders.  My jaw dropped as I heard one trader coolly telling a California energy power station to 'power down' for a bit, by 'making up' an excuse, so they could artificially limit California's energy supply to make obscene profits.  Even worse were traders laughing hysterically and cheering as energy power lines burned in California, chanting \\\"Burn Baby Burn!!\\\"  And why not?  Supposedly a young trader could make enough in one afternoon to buy a Mercedes Benz, flat out!Other facets of the ugly face of Enron included the bizarre 'extreme sport' trips taken by Enron Execs (bunch of guys riding motor cycles in the dirt) and the practice of taking clients out to strip clubs and charging it to the corporate account (exemplified by Lou Pai, but was popular among the rest as well- when this was eventually cancelled at the severe protest of some female employees, apparently a pall of silence fell over the trading floor for 3 days!).  There is also Enron's arrogance that it could 'trade' everything, including the weather!Jeff Skilling comes off as particularly arrogant- he states he wanted to help FORTUNE reporter Bethany Mclean \\\"understand what she is asking\\\" when she wanted to know why Enron's numbers didn't add up. When despite his bullying, she decided to publish her findings (or lack of) anyway, he amazingly calls her decision 'unethical.'  Well, clearly, Mclean did know what she was asking- \\\"IS ENRON OVERPRICED\\\" was the first article suggesting something maybe wrong with Enron.  Later, he calls someone else who questioned the validity of Enron's accounting an \\\"a-- h---.\\\"Compared to Skilling and the others, Ken Lay comes off as rather clueless, but just as greedy. It is almost as if he didn't really care what went on in his company, as long as it made money.  We see him on 9-11-2001 comparing Enron's troubles to 9-11, but stating with confidence that things will bounce back.  Later, when Enron is in a free fall, he makes bizarre claims to his worried employees that the company is strong, and will regain healthy stock figures, causing one of his employees to ask him \\\"are you are on crack.\\\"  Indeed.  The film also highlights the fact that guilt for the Enron debacle falls far beyond Enron itself.  Greedy corporate banks actively participated in illegal money-making deals with Fastow, as mentioned above.  Accounting firm Arthur Anderson happily cooked Enron's books with Mark-to-Marketing accounting and other accounding frauds, and then shredded millions of documents when investigations began.  Stock analysts happily took Jeff Skilling's word that Enron's stock was doing great- and issued 'strong buy' or 'buy' ratings, without actually analyzing the stock.  Lawyers signed off on everything.  And the rest of us, dazzled by the stock market boom and greedy at the thought of making big bucks, kept buying Enron stock.  No one ever \\\"asked why\\\" Enron was such a shining star- and whether it really deserved to be.    The insider material on Enron (the recordings, the videos) alone would have made a fascinating, shocking tale.  But the movie adds incisive, fast paced interviews with both insiders and critics of Enron, as well as catchy, and very appropriate theme tunes.  (`Dear Mr. Fantasy' for Andy Fastow is particularly appropriate- as it sounds like `Dear Mr. Fastow!')As Amazon suggests, watch this move with THE CORPORATION.  THE CORPORATION provides the theoretical background as to the psychopathic nature of all corporations, while this movie provides the perfect, feature length case-study.  \"},\"702\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"****1\\/2Don't be surprised if you find yourself throwing things at the screen while watching \\\"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,\\\" a brilliantly effective and meticulously researched documentary (based on the book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind) that is guaranteed to get both your dander and your adrenaline up to dangerously high levels.Rarely does a real life event provide us with as clear and universally recognized a symbol of a larger social theme as does the fall of Enron, which, in the years since it happened, has come to stand for everything that's wrong with corporate America.  It is the classic tale of corruption and unethical behavior performed in the service of unbridled greed.  That the men responsible for the disaster took so many innocent people down with them is what makes it a tragedy.  In fact, more than one person interviewed for the film draws the parallel between the downfall of Enron and the sinking of the Titanic - an apt analogy if ever there was one, only, in this case, the captains had no intention of going down with the ship, preferring instead to ruthlessly knock over any number of helpless women and children in the desperate race to the lifeboats. The beauty of the film is that it takes a very complex and convoluted story and makes it completely comprehensible to those of us who might otherwise get lost in the maze of arcane corporate-world details.   The movie introduces us to the key players - primarily CEOs Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay, and CFO Andrew Fastow - showing the step-by-step process by which they built the energy corporation virtually from scratch, raised it to the position of seventh largest company in the world, then slowly destroyed it through deceit, hubris and greed - but not, of course, before bestowing obscene multi-million dollar packages on themselves as compensation.  We see how they employed little more than smoke-and-mirror accounting schemes to pull the wool over the eyes of investors, regulatory commissions and fellow employees.  However, the film makes it clear that a large number of \\\"reputable\\\" banks and loan agencies must also have been complicit in the company's malfeasance for all of this to have come off so effectively.   As always, it is the \\\"little guy\\\" who winds up getting shafted.  Probably the greatest hair-pulling section of the film involves Enron's cold-blooded creation and manipulation of California's bogus \\\"energy crisis\\\" in the early 2000's, which drained billions from the state`s treasury, a situation which the newly elected President Bush, ever sympathetic to his buddies in the energy business, refused to help rectify.  Just as bad is the CEOs' callous encouragement of their own lower level employees to invest their retirement savings in the company's 401K plan that the chief executives themselves knew would soon be defunct.  With hissable villains like these around, who needs fiction?The sole consolation is the fact that the system did work in the end, that the wrongdoers eventually overreached to such an extent that the house of cards they had built finally came tumbling down.  There's certainly a great deal of joy in seeing the creeps responsible for the catastrophe being carted off to jail in handcuffs and sweating under the public scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee.  (It should be noted that the film predates Ken Lay's death in 2006).  The movie also balances the case by highlighting some of the \\\"heroes\\\" in the story, primarily whistleblowers within the company and a resourceful reporter for FORTUNE magazine who was the first to hint in a public forum that Enron might just be the corporate equivalent of the emperor with no clothes.This is more than just a mere \\\"talking heads\\\" documentary.  It explores the details of the story within the broader context of unbridled capitalism, de-regulation, and corporate corruption.  The movie also shows us how strangely immature the men at the head of this company were, with their frat boy antics and the daredevil activities they indulged in to erase their \\\"nerd\\\" image and to establish their bona fides as real \\\"macho\\\" men.  The fact that individuals of this caliber could spell the ruin of so many trusting people is what gives the movie's title that little ironic kick.By all means, don't miss this film - though you might want to have a good stiff drink handy for when it's over\"},\"703\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"This dvd I received was way better than chocolate.

The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time? The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank.

If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying \\\"Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high\\/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one. \"},\"730\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"    In 1988, director George Sluizer had directed a film entitled, THE VANISHING. The film was all in Dutch and starred Dutch actors, who are nowhere near well-known in this country.    In 1993, director George Sluizer, who had directed the original Dutch film, had decided to direct a remake of his own film, this time, casting a well-known cast that consists of Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock,  Jeff Bridges. The film is almost the same as the original Dutch version, but this one is much more worth the time and money.    JEFF HARRIMAN (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend, DIANE SHAVER (played by Sandra Bullock) are driving to the mountains for vacation. They have a little spout, after their car runs out of gas, while in a dark tunnel. Leaving Diane there, Jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station. He comes back to find Diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel, upset and distraught. They pull into a gas station, where Diane has Jeff, who laughs with cheerfulness, repeat an apology. They kiss passionately, where Diane heads into the store to buy her and Jeff some cold beers. A half-hour goes by and Diane has not yet returned. He searches the store, as well as the whole ground, but Diane is nowhere to be found.    Three years later, Jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend. Every month for the last three years, Jeff would renew the posters he had printed of Diane. He has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped Diane to tell him where she is. He walks into a diner one night, still very miserable, and meets RITA BAKER (played by Nancy Travis). Rita is instantly attracted to Jeff. Jeff and Rita begin a love affair together. Jeff tries to move on with his life, but he cannot, for he is still searching for Diane. Rita finds out about what Jeff is doing behind her back. She tries to help get over his obsession, but it doesn't work. Jeff receives a letter from a man named BARNEY COUSINS (played by Jeff Bridges). Jeff shows Rita the letter, but she realizes that his obsession is still going on, where she leaves him. She goes to their appartment, packs her things, changes the outgoing message on their answering machine. Jeff returns home and changes the machine himself, but as the recording is still going, Barney appears. Jeff beats the hell out of him, but Barney reveals that he can tell him where Diane is, and that in order for Jeff to find out what happened to her, he'd have to ride with Barney.    While at a bar with her girlfriend, Rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message, but Rita hears that Jeff had already changed it, to which she finds Barney's voice on the machine. She realizes that Jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him, but Jeff and Barney are already on their way.    Rita finds out what happened from her neighbor, where her neighbor gives Rita the license plate number to Barney's car. With this License Plate #, Rita finds out where Barney lives and drives off to his place.    Jeff and Barney arrive at the gas station where Diane was last seen three years earlier. Barney hands Jeff a cup of coffee, where Barney informs Jeff that the coffee is drugged. He tells Jeff that in order to find out what happened to Diane, Jeff has to go through the exact same details that Diane had gone through. Jeff, through hurtful tears, drinks the coffee and blacks out. He wakes up to darkness. He flips on his lighter to find himself locked...in a coffin and...buried alive outside Barney's vacation cabin in the woods. Barney had done this to poor Diane, who, after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid, is now dead.    Rita arrives at Barney's house, where she meets Barney's daughter, DENISE (played by Maggie Linderman). She asks Rita to giver her a ride to the carnival, as long as she doesn't say a word to to Barney. Rita asks Denise how to get to the summer cabin where Barney is at. Denise gives her the directions and Rita is on her way. She arrives and has a brief brawl with Barney. She stops when he is about to kill her. She is now seated inside his cabin, talking with Barney, trying to find out what he did with Jeff. She notices the dirt on his shoes, the dirt on a shovel, standing beside the door, and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass, and realizes that Barney had buried Jeff alive. She knocks Barney and begins digging up Jeff. But not before Barney awakens and begins brawling again with Rita. Did Jeff suffocate and bite the dust as Diane had done? Will Barney kill of Rita as well? The only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of THE VANISHING.    I have read the reviews from many Amazon.com reviewers and I cannot believe that anyone would hate this remake. So what? The ending was changed. I do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie. This movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake.

It is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in Urban America where youth gangs run rampant. During the course of the story, it offers much needed commentary on thesituation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it.At the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says \\\"One out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime, most will be killed at the hands of another black male.\\\" If anything, that fact is even worse today. Most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film, but many of thesefilms today are all shoot `em up movies that have no morality, strong plot or serious social message.The setting of this flick is South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer. Over the past two decades the Los Angeles Police Department has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3\\/4ths of the city's total.This gripping tale evolves around a single black father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), raising his one and only son, Tr\\u00ef\\u00bf\\u00bd Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and installing in him the values to help him become a man. This is an important point that director John Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The values that Furious Styles instills in Tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today.Essentially, Boyz n the Hood is a movie about peace. Its message is that violence isn't the answer, and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are other alternatives available. The movie starts when Tre's mother sends himto live with his father Jason, a\\/k\\/a \\\"Furious\\\", whois much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. The movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old Tre and his best friend Ricky about to graduate from high school, whileanother friend Doughboy has already graduated - fromshoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility and self-respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring. The basic plot to Boyz n the Hood is can Tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal, decent life? This is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him. Boyz n the Hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings. It shows thedire straits that folks in the South Central are in without being conscending or exploitative. Boyz n the Hood is a flick that is well written, acted and directed. The cinematography is stunning\"},\"735\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"This is truly a BRILLIANT movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the \\\"real\\\" hood is really like.  For me this was nothing less than educational.  I could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale (the hood) which they are powerless to escape or ignore.  This is more than just a movie, it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down, and exposes the humanity of the characters.  When watching the movie, I could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish --- these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood, but humans with hopes, feelings and aspirations, just like you and me.  What more can I say, except: BRAVO!\"},\"736\":{\"category\":\"dvd\",\"text\":\"This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings.This movie truly captures the struggle millions of African Americans go through. As we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto, to when they are old enough to get out, they still seem to be the same. Their customs dont change, simply because of their surrounding, guns, liquor, poverty, and crime. They have no other option than do join in. When dough boy's(Ice Cube) brother Ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto.

It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America.  I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie.  This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script.  Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne).  Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual.  Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube)  Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother.  The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends.  It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great.I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central.

We got a problem? He pulls aside his coat flashing a .45 concealed in his pants and flashes gang signs.The bloods flash gang signs back. Doughboy pulls back the slide on his gat (cocking it). The gangsters give him a dirty look, turn their backs and walk away. Right when the crowds are ready to leave, the bloods open the trunk of their tricked out hyundai and fire a fully automatic uzi in the air. Ricky and Tre drive off together saying, \\\"can't go nowhere without getting all shot up and crap.\\\" They get pulled over and hassled by the cops. Tre drives over to his girlfriends house and he shows sad and angry emotions. She comforts him and they end up making love. About 15-20 minutes near the end of the movie, Rickys wife asks him to go the the convenience store to get some cornmeal. He walks a few blocks from his house with tre and walks out of the store with the cornmeal, a container of milk, and several lottery tickets. Ricky and Tre are walking back home and Ricky is totally unaware that his SAT scores for college are waiting for him when he gets home. He scored just enough to get him accepted into USC. The red hyundai pulls up on a side street and the bloods inside are saying, \\\"Theres that bastard that was talking smack the other night.\\\" The gangsters grab their guns and the car peels out around the corner catching Ricky and Tre running and ducking into an alley near a wooden fence down the street. The fellas inside the car are shouting, \\\"Cut him off man. Lets kill him. Come on man, go.\\\" The leader of the gang steps on the gas and the car races down the street after them.

The first one hits him in the legs to cripple him and the 2nd shot hits him blowing a hole in his chest, knocking him to the ground. There is so much blood all over. Tre tries to comfort him Ricky and keep him concious as Doughboys car pulls up. Ricky dies in Tres arms and they take him home. Rickys mother comes unglued and the mom thinks that Doughboy is the one who shot him. She starts beating on him like crazy. Tre pulls him away from her on the porch. Tres clothes are covered from head to toe in blood and he tells Doughboy \\\"meet me at my house in 5 minutes.\\\" Tres girlfriend tries to stop him to see whats up and he tells her to go home.

Tre falls into his dads arms and begins sobbing. His dad says, \\\"Your my only son and I'm not gonna lose you to any crap. I love you man. Go clean yourself up. Go on.\\\" Tre goes back to his bedroom knowing that his buddies are outside waiting for him in the car. He jumps out the window and runs to the car jumping in the back of the car. They race off and his father and buddy Chris are thinking, \\\"oh shoot.\\\" Tres father is very nervous because he knows what the guys plan to do after the tragic  bloody afternoon. Tre does a lot of thinking in the backseat and orders his friends to pull over the car and let him out. They do as he wants.

They pull into a burger joint and find the gangsters outside eating burgers at a table. They load  cock a fully automatic AK-47, turn off the lights on the car, and pull a drive by shooting on every single person at the table. The car comes to a screeching halt, doughboy cocks his sidearm and runs up to the surviving gangsters and murders every single one of them in cold blood. They peel out of the parking lot and the following morning Tre ends up talking to Tre about how hard it is to break the cycle of violence growing up in the hood. Doughboy says, \\\"They sure pushed the clock on Rick man. I ain't got no brother. Next thing you know somebody might try to smoke me. Don't matter though. We all gotta go sometime huh?\\\" Tre tries to comfort him by saying, \\\"Hey dough. You still got one brother left man.\\\" Doughboy says, \\\"Thanks man.\\\" Doughboy and Tre embrace with a hug. Doughboy walks away pouring out his bottle of OE as an homage to his mudered brother and then a message comes up on the screen saying \\\"2 weeks later doughboy is murdered.\\\" How sad.

Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is \\\"I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job.\\\" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, \\\"I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too.\\\" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how \\\"real\\\" Furious was. \\\"Young\\\" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe.

Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called \\\"Firewall.\\\" Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to \\\"Firewall\\\" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is \\\"In the Line of Fire.\\\" It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself \\\"that sounds\\/looks familiar.\\\" I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time.

My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to\"},\"754\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it.

The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff!

He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  \\\"Child of God\\\" is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.

I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.

In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.In this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.When the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.Nigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.At Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.Lord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.In McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.This story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.BTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?Highly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.-Arthur W.

Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing\"},\"763\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"It completely sucked.

If they're all this bad, I'll be avoiding that discount database in the future\"},\"764\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like \\\"what just happened!\\\". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.There seem to be no faults in the utopian \\\"good guys\\\" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest.

Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400.

The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels.I found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops.

Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read.

In fact, if it weren't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I'd have given this book two, maybe three stars.  Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here.  Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity\\/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism\\/Islam in Africa, Islam\\/Buddhism\\/Hinduism\\/Shintoism\\/Anamism in Asia, etc.  But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the \\\"Lord and Lady\\\" actually interact with some of the characters.  Yet the characters don't sit there and think to themselves, \\\"Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!\\\"  Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind.  Oh, well.  My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum.  We don't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let's try to keep to a minimum the \\\"blessed be's\\\" or \\\"lord and lady\\\" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay\"},\"767\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook.

Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.His scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.Taylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.As the first book in the \\\"Penguin History of the United States,\\\" Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come\"},\"775\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done\"},\"776\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans.\"},\"777\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"The above is my favorite book and SLB conjured up similar emotions in me.

This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films.  In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists.  In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party.  This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist.  And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings.But this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as right-wing Republicans.  While I am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left, I find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias.  The significance of this book to me from reading Ring Lardner's famous \\\"I'd Hate Myself in the Morning\\\" to watching Woody Allen's \\\"The Front\\\" and FINALLY getting a closing answer is overwhelming.  I no longer feel the need to explore why Americans chose to follow another government's agenda to the potential detriment of our country.  However, I do not fault these people for their initial attraction to communism and frankly, I don't view communism as wrong:  it's just a different government method some choose.  For myself, I remain quite satisfied with democracy, EVEN in these trying times.  Rather, the attraction to communism was clearly a byproduct of the recent depression as well as the growth of fascism.  I can live with that reasoning.This is an exceptional book if you have any interest in the 50s, movies, or communism.  In closing, I must comment on the complete disrespect shown to Elia Kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when Nick Nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award.  I suggest they read this book.  The Red Scare was a horrible period but Freedom of Speech needs only go so far when supporting a government with intent to overthrow our own.  I strongly recommend this book.\"},\"786\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"While George Clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his \\\"community\\\" are proudly out of touch with mainstream America, I was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by Ronald and Allis Radosh. For readers with an interest in the context of the culture-clash between the \\\"Hollywood elite\\\" and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and DVDs, this book is an excellent resource.I say the \\\"context\\\" of the clash because this is a look at history, and a serious research work too. This is not a book that details the fashionable Leftist obsessions of Clooney, Streisand, Penn, and the rest, and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly. Instead, \\\"Red Star Over Hollywood\\\" digs deep into something far more serious and sinister (\\\"sinister\\\" comes from the Latin word for \\\"left,\\\" by the way): the film colony's infiltration by agents of the Comintern, dedicated partisans of Stalin, and other actors, directors, writers, and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the United States.As Clooney's speech -- and even more so, his movie -- make clear, modern Hollywood's sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against \\\"McCarthyism\\\" and the blacklist (that's what makes Clooney's self-congratulation so laughable -- does anyone in Hollywood *defend* McCarthy?). But the Radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence (in other words, the witch-hunt turned up real witches), but that there was also a strong and active anti-communist Left in Hollywood. Even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in Hollywood, it was this anti-communist Left that was in the most direct conflict with the Stalinists, their apologists, and their dupes, particularly before and during World War II.All of this is important information, but it's when they turn to their discussion of HUAC and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront Hollywood's defining myth. Far from the usual pop-psychology analysis of the deranged and sweaty McCarthy (and why do so few people seem to notice that *Senator* Joe McCarthy had nothing to do with the *House* Committee on Un-American Activities?) the authors have gone in-depth in committee records, and also into the backgrounds of the people from Hollywood who came before the committee. It's certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of McCarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents. Ronald and Allis Radosh are to be commended for doing the latter.It's because this book is so heavily researched -- so filled with names, dates, and places -- that I note again that it may not be to everyone's taste. It is, I repeat, a work of history. It notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of, say, an Ann Coulter book, and so doesn't have the fist-pumping, take-that-you-commie excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works. But those books seem to disappear as soon as they fall off the bestseller lists. This, on the other hand, is a book that deserves to be around for a long, long time\"},\"787\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's \\\"Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left.\\\"Talk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true \\\"United Frontism\\\" and \\\"Popular Front\\\" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed \\\"revisionist\\\" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like \\\"Mission to Moscow,\\\" \\\"The Spanish Earth,\\\" and \\\"The North Star.\\\" Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.I enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. \\\"Red Star Over Hollywood\\\" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another \\\"we were innocent\\\" propaganda piece.\"},\"788\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"I have always been curious about the influence of Communism in Hollywood.  This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it.  It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated.  It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation.  I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful.  The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions.    Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union.  It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union.  Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors.    Finally, the Radoshes put the \\\"Hollywood Ten\\\" and the blacklist years in perspective.  They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated.   I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost.  It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed.

But despite an obvious bias built in to the account, the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know, but might not, after the shouting matches over McCarthyism. I really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction, but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading. Conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business, but you can read around the lurid conservative passages (not so bad) for some useful corrections of the record, and no doubt much left out.\"},\"790\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"It's no secret that many of Hollywood's and the entertainment businesss's current \\\"stars\\\" are socialist afficienados (or worse), but where did this denationalized elitism come from? \\\"Red Star Over Hollywood\\\" does a spectacular job at laying out the groundwork and background of the Hollywood political left, Communists and fellow travelers from the 1930's to 1950's. With about 37 pages of reference material (diaries, speeches, Congressional testimony, biographies, autobiographies, news articles, interviews, etc.), the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the Soviet Union in its attempts to \\\"take over\\\" Hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a Soviet America. The names of the actors, screen writers, producers etc who were card carrying Communists, fellow travelers, quislings, leftists, and varieties of socialists who made up the Hollywood scene in those days will floor you. You'll have to read the book to find out who they were.  And there were many heroes as well, who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs. You'll never watch movies on the Turner Classic Movies channel the same way again.

Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin's \\\"Red Terror,\\\" the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin's purges of the late 30's, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on \\\"McCarthyism\\\" and the ghastly \\\"blacklist.\\\" They're listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don't believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that's no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over \\\"McCarthyism,\\\" the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn't have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps!The Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30's and 40's was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin's mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin's secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin's killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the \\\"horrors\\\" of \\\"McCarthyism.\\\"While no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her \\\"hero\\\" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see \\\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\\" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood \\\"useful idiots\\\" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet's crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of \\\"The Motorcycle Diaries,\\\" a saintly portrayal of Castro's chief executioner Ernesto \\\"Che\\\" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of \\\"counter-revolutionaries\\\" at La Cabana prison, something that's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro.The negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can't refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts.

Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party.The Radoshes describe the infatuation of \\\"the Hollywood Party\\\" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union.  They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the \\\"Hollywood Ten\\\" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the \\\"Ten\\\" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work.  The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, \\\"Mission to Moscow.\\\" This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin's purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed.  Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either \\\"named names\\\" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names.  For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration.If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony's long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book.

Over and over and over it seems, doesn't it?  Well now we have a detailed and painstakingly written rejoinder, \\\"Red Star Over Hollywood\\\", which tells the real tale; that these were mostly hard core members of the communist party USA, who took their marching orders directly from the Kremlin.  They were Stalin's men and, not to put to fine a point on it, useful idiots in his quest to foment a world-wide communist revolution.Ron Radosh, a communist from childhood, smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the Rosenberg's only to find that .... they were guilty!

Unfortunately, one doesn't find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians, archeologists, political scientists, reporters, book publishers or video media types.  As an aside, I found it interesting to compare this book with Neil gabler's, \\\"An Empire of Their Own: How the Jew's Invented Hollywood.\\\"  The nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a world-wide communistic revolution?  Is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism?  I don't know, but I for one would encourage Radosh to address the subject.  And, he's the man to do it (another book to read as a companion peace would be \\\"Intellectuals\\\" by Paul Johnson, the author of \\\"Modern Times.\\\")It's important to recognize that not all of those in Hollywood, whose lives were ruined by HUAC, were hard-core communists.  Some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices.  To the readers benefit, Radosh teases out these nuances rather well, and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest.Setting the record straight is important, but the Hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a \\\"fable of innocence destroyed by malice.\\\"  It's their shakey attempt at moral authority, the kind that underpins a Sean Penn in his critique of Bush's Iraq policy, while he ignores the evils of Sadaam Hussein.This book challenges the template of the Hollywood left: that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against right-wing bullies leading a witch hunt against \\\"un-American activities;\\\" that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers.

She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters.

It's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that Bush would have won anyway. Palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up. But Palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote, and the votes that were not counted.He charges that more than 57,000 law-abiding citizens were improperly labeled as felons, and were kept from voting in Florida. These were almost all African-American who universally vote Democrat. There was an 80% criteria for finding a match of felon names. The company Choice Point started with a 90% match, but the state told them that was too high! They were told to make it an 80% match.So, a felon named John Johnson Jr. would also keep a law-abiding citizen named Jack Johnson or John O. Johnson from voting too. When did the state of Florida inform these people that they were on a felons list and could not vote? They didn't, even though they were supposed to give ample notice to allow any mistake to be corrected.The company that got the job of putting the fix in, Choice Point was awarded a multi-million dollar contract over other companies that would have done the same job better for literally pennnies per voter. Florida decided to pay much more per voter with Choice Point.Now here's the lie. Choice Point said that they did not use race as a criterion, but it was used as a matching criterion. Presto! Even with the disproportionate number of Blacks in the prison population, Palasts states that the number kept from voting was statistically way out of proportion to the number of felons.Just to ensure the outcome, the voting machines in Black neighborhoods were fewer and older than the ones in White neighborhoods. In some cases 18% of the Black vote was thrown out for one reason or another while in White neighborhoods were 1 to 2% was the norm. This was the perfect scam since anyone knows that Blacks would overwhelmingly vote for Gore, and the Whites would have had a large voting block for Bush.Florida's official reason was that the law prohibited felons from voting. They didn't want any felons to try to vote. (?)Palast asks, what felon wants to vote so badly that he would risk going back to jail for it? Good point! Not one person in Florida was arrested for voting twice.Then, there were the roving republican goon squads who went to wherever the recount was attempted to intimidate the recount process.Palast accuses the press of doing nothing or investigating nothing about a national election that was obviously rigged. When he offered the story to CBS, a network that has long since cowed to conservative screams of bias, they refused. Why? The CBS executive called the state of Florida to verify the story. They, the state, assured them there was nothing to it? Isn't that like asking the fox if he can be trusted to protect the henhouse? Palast gained a large audience in Europe bringing this story to light. It received almost no attention here, and when it did, it was way after the election.This was the most important part of the book for me. While I enjoyed his commentary on Wackenhut and other exposes, this one was the most riveting. It scares me. This isn't supposed to happen in the US. That is why I recommend this book and especially his newer one, \\\"Armed Madhouse.\\\"Palast proves by showing leaked documents, pictures and statistic improbability that this and the 2004 election were stolen by electronic ballot stuffing.

Between these covers, Palast demonstrates repeatedly why EVERYone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts.  While I'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations, the policies and actions carried out by the Bush Administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of Palast's claims in broad daylight.If only the mainstream media were paying attention.  Then again, the mainstream media is owned by corporations that make money selling fluff and not upsetting too many of their readers, viewers, and\\/or listeners.  So why should we expect otherwise?Occasionally, Palast pushes the envelope on his ability to actually KNOW the motivations and responsibilities (blame) of various people he is writing about here.  More often than not, however, he simply puts forth so many facts, and connects so many dots for us, that it's difficult to not come to many of the same conclusions he has.  And, again, the actions of the Bush Administration -- and various members and associates of the Bush family -- have born out many of those conclusions over the past few years.Read this book and compare it with news stories from the past 5-to-6 years and, if you have done any digging at all, you will quickly see how scary the truth really can be.  Hopefully, you'll also see how important it is now to stand up, speak out, and fight for genuine middle class America and those folks even less fortunate than us.

In this book, Kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians, as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals.I believe most of David Kennedy's interpretations and judgments are well reasoned. However, I disagree with his deemphasis upon the major decline in the stock market between late 1929 - 1931 as one of the main causes of the Great Depression.Even more so I dissent very strongly with David Kennedy's suggestion the Roosevelt administration should have tried harder to avoid war with Japan by essentially appeasing Japanese aggression against China. To quote from his book, Kennedy writes on page 513: \\\"Why not acquiesce, however complainingly, in the Japanese action in China, reopen at least limited trade with Japan...\\\" Given the fact that Japanese aggression and atrocities in China were as bad or worse as Germany's in Europe by late 1941, I find Kennedy's opinion morally reprehensible.In general, this is a very good book, covering social, economic, political and military history of the era. However, don't read \\\"Freedom from Fear,\\\" expecting to learn much about cultural history in the United States between the Great Depression and World War II.\"},\"861\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Freedom From Fear is an exhaustive study of America and its people during two of this country's most defining periods, the Great Depression and World War II. David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.This period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.The Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.The New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.The turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.The major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.This book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written. I've studied this period before, but I found this book very rewarding in that I also learned quite a bit I knew little or nothing about. I would highly recommend this book\"},\"862\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Despite the newfound popularity of social history, and ethnic history, and gender history, it's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice old-fashioned survey history of America. Heavy on political history, Freedom from Fear tells the story of America during the Great Depression and the Second World War. It is a survey, but it is broad and deep, running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years. David Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning text is worth every penny.Given the two broad subjects, it's not surprising that the book is essentially divided into two sections. In the first, Kennedy takes us on a journey into the downward spiral of the American economy during the Hoover years.  Maligned by history, Hoover could have been a better president than he was, but events overwhelmed him. Even his great success in life prior to winning the White House did not prepare him for the immensity of the task. Indeed, possibly no one could have handled it. But Roosevelt is seen here to have been up to the challenge. Not of actually fixing the problems. Kennedy is quite frank in his evaluation of Roosevelt's New Deal programs and his performance in such matters. In many places Roosevelt could have done better, perhaps by adopting a more internationalist approach to economics, or by not antagonizing and demoralizing the business community.More broadly, we see the decline in living conditions, and at the same time the rise of labor unions and government programs both useful and not. We see the uneven performance of the economy in various parts of the country, and the desperate mobility that sometimes resulted. We see a country scared and in turmoil, unsure of itself and its destiny.But though the Depression dragged on, waxing and waning, events elsewhere in the world did not stop to wait. Though America was among the hardest hit of countries, it was not the worst behaving on the international scene. Rumbles of war began in Europe and in Asia, and America stood aside hoping to avoid it all. Of course this was not to be, and with the Japanese attack America found itself thrust into total war. The economy was finally freed of the doldrums by massive war spending. The people were roused from stupor by the drumbeats of battle. Alliances solidified, and the enemies were targeted. And America joined the war in its own unique way. It could never be said that America takes no advantage of its industrial strength. While the countries of Europe dealt with the situation forced upon them, America armed itself and prepped for battle. It built its forces. It provided machinery and equipment to allies. It transformed factories to a war production mode. Industrial geniuses, pumped with cash, streamlined methods of mass production on a scale never imagined before. And newer and better weapons came to be. More than in most books, Kennedy makes it clear that the American effort in war was a mechanized and deliberate effort. When the Western front opened, it was run with industrial clarity of purpose.If there is a dominant theme in Freedom From Fear, it is that America runs on its commerce.  The business of America really is business. With or without government regulation, with or without organized labor, it is economy that runs Kennedy's America. But with such sweeping vision and engaging style, the reader could do much worse to learn about America in the interesting times than to read this gripping account\"},\"863\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"There is much to like in David Kennedy's history of the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s.  His book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period.  His examination of the New Deal is both insightful and judicious, while his description of America in the Second World War is gripping and informative.  Throughout the book Kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events, discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the American people and their government.Yet in some respects the volume is something of a disappointment.  The book is a contribution to the superb \\\"Oxford History of the United States\\\" series, which has set a high standard with its earlier volumes.  It is by this measure that Kennedy's book is wanting; it is hardly the comprehensive examination of its topic that the earlier volumes were, as his focus on politics and economics gives short shrift to American culture and society during the period.  Moreover, his prose often seems excessively grandiose.  Efforts to create soaring metaphors often become too labored and fall flat, making for a stark contrast with the clear descriptions and jargon-free analysis they buttress.Nevertheless, Kennedy's achievement with this book is impressive.  He has provided a well-written account of America's efforts to deal with some of the greatest challenges that the nation ever faced.  Readers seeking a history of the period would be hard pressed to find a better and more readable book with which to start\"},\"864\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"With W. Bush preparing to undo the last vestiges of the New Deal, whether you agree with him or not I can't think of a better time, and reason for reading this remarkable study by David Kennedy.Kennedy debunks much of what the remnants of history have left most of us about Herbert Hoover. I think this was the most surprising part of the book because everything I had read, seen, or heard up until now left only negative impressions of the man. I have a both a new respect for Hoover as a man, dour though he was, and a clearer understanding of why he failed as a politician. I also have a fresh reminder of how nothing is really original - FDR borrowed much of the New Deal from Hoover.  But where Hoover couldn't make the ideological leap from good ideas that were to be voluntary only with only minimal government assistance, FDR was amenable to trying anything, including transformational ideas such as mandatory business compliance with Federal regulation, an evening-up of the playing field between business (which had corporatized) and labor (which until FDR hadn't the power to do the same) and labor, to massive government spending. Although FDR didn't understand Keyensian economics, he nevertheless proved the theory.FDR defined the \\\"general welfare\\\" clause of the Constitution, and left a legacy that has affected every single one of us ever since, and continues to do so today.Beside the in-depth look at the Great Depression, Kennedy also provides a survey of WWII, debunking many more myths along the way, and exposing the beginnings of the cold war in FDR  Churchill's unkept promises to Stalin about the opening of a second front in Europe.I consider this a \\\"must read\\\" for anyone who considers him\\/herself interested in American History\"},\"865\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"This is a very literate and enjoyable history.

Peter Drucker discusses how the new paradigms of management have change and will continue to change our basics assumptions and principles of management\"},\"869\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Drucker outlines lessons that management can learn from the changing world economy and population.1. Management is not just business management, but is the ability to take advantage of opportunities in sectors of the economy that are likely to experience growth in the future, like education, the professions, and healthcare.2. Recognize that there is not one ideal way to organize an enterprise.  Both \\\"team\\\" organization and the \\\"CEO cult of personality\\\" have their shortcomings.  It can be difficult for teams to make decisions effectively and popular CEO's must have successors.  You must find the right balance of organization that fits your company's business needs.3. There is no one way to organize employees.  You need to lead workers rather than manage employees.  This is because management increasingly does not know the areas of expertise that employees possess, and employees are now seeking interesting and rewarding work.4. National boundaries and regional markets will become less defining factors of the companies boundaries.  Innovations in an industry don't necessarily come from within the industry anymore.  Further, national governments will be less able to protect local industries from facing the competitiveness of the global industry leaders.  Global competitiveness must become a strategic goal for the business.Drucker also outlines the economic consequences of the declining birthrate in the developed countries.  A declining birthrate means that the working population will become progressively older.  New relationships must be forged with older workers, especially knowledge workers.  Companies that attract and retain knowledge workers past retirement age will gain a significant competitive advantage.Managers must become Change Leaders, who direct inevitable change in a controlled and orderly fashion.  Managers must look to extending the lifespan of their companies and approaching change as a source of business opportunity.\"},\"870\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"Peter Drucker, an editorial columnist for the Wall Street Journal, a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world's most respected management thinkers. His books, over 20 of them, have been called the \\\"landmarks of the managerial profession\\\" by the Harvard Business Review.  He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought.  In 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams.'  In 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers' concept.Here Drucker lays out six of the 'new' challenges facing the businesses of the early 21st century.First involves management's new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people.  There is no 'one size fits all' approach.  The method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is 'value.'  Employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers, 'persuaded' rather than 'ordered.'The next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape.  The collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for.  Global competitiveness is a must for survival.  Performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just short-term gains in order to inspire and commit 'knowledge workers' to their mission.Third is becoming a change leader.  Educate others that change equals opportunity.  Regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results.  Enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company.  Study what is working or not in the market with other companies. Don't confuse motion with action.Fourth are the information challenges.  The purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action.  Success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer.  Information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity, competence and allocation of scarce resources information.The fifth challenge lies in vitalizing 'knowledge workers' into high productivity.  Attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow.  Differing from manual laborers, knowledge workers carry the 'means of production' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work.The sixth challenge is managiing ourself (ourselves).  The biggest possible increase in production lies here.  Intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance.  Concentrate on your strengths.  Avoid trying to change yourself.  Ask yourself what your strengths are.  Determine how you work.  Do you like to work alone?  Would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker?  What are your values?  This type of questioning will help determine where you belong.  Most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once.  You must learn what makes 'you' tick.Five Stars\"},\"871\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"This book is first published in 1999.

Few companies exemplify this better than Wal-Mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain.Perhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer, Drucker recognized that \\\"more and more people in the workforce - and most knowledge works - will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES.\\\" (Emphasis in original.) Drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives, something he himself did.As Drucker put it in his introduction, the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century.

This book covers that momentous year and much more as well.I had the good fortune of living in San Francisco for two years in the mid 1980s and experienced one relatively small earthquake.

He puts this all in perspective and wonderfully entertains the reader along the way.  His analysis of Portola Valley as a \\\"deeply dangerous place (that is) liable to be destroyed at any moment\\\" is courageously and provocatively true.  I have visited this town many times and been simply amazed at how people can deny the very obvious fact that there lives rest upon a ticking time bomb.

I learned about plate tectonics, the formation of the world, the settlement of the American West, earthquakes in the Midwest, and much more, but only 50-75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in San Francisco, and once the fire it put out, the book quickly ends.  There is a little discussion about the rebuilding, but mostly just to disparage the effort.  Winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of Latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling.

However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books \\\"Krakatoa\\\" and \\\"The Map That Changed The World\\\". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (\\\"From Plate to Shining Plate\\\"), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his \\\"Annals of the Former World\\\".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name.

As with any great journey, some parts are better and more interesting than others--but the combined and lasting understanding of the science and history to be derived from reading this book is unequalled.  Suffice it to say that upon completion of \\\"Crack\\\" the reader understands earthquakes and their impact upon our world.Think of your favorite lecturer in college and you get a sense for Winchester's style--a style wryly self-referenced as bloviation.  His diversions are often entirely unexpected (and not always entirely supportable) but enjoyable and thought-provoking nonetheless.  He communicates a sense of the joy of scholarship and discovery--being able to drive up to Alaska, for example, just to see how the big pipe fared in the massive Denali quake; being able to utterly discredit the worthless dreck rushed into print shortly after the disaster; pointing to that most Californian of attitudes--the stunning failure to take advantage of the opportunity to re-create San Francisco according to a grand master plan, a mistake echoed in Southern California's loss of the redcars in favor of freeways.What Mr. Winchester desperately needs is a format that allows him more graphical content.  Something along the old TimeLife science series or the Dorling Kindersley formats.

He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.

To honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I reread Randy Shilts's groundbreaking work, which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the CDC.It is still an intense and provocative book that reveals the social and political motives that became both pathways and obstacles for finding a cause and a cure for the killer disease. Shilts, who tested positive during the research for his book, but said he didn't ask for the results until his writing was finished, nonetheless brings an emotional bias to his research. His regret (he engaged in many of the risky sexual practices against which he rails) runs like an electric current throughout and gives his story a kind of missionary momentum and zeal.As a result, \\\"And the Band Played On\\\" survives as a masterpiece of nonfiction storytelling because it is as much about a human disease as it is about the human condition including themes of betrayal and sacrifice, fear and love, exuberance and panic, loss and redemption - contrasts that the play \\\"Angels in America\\\" perfectly captured when it premiered in 1991.Shilts explored AIDS in America as a disease of both body and spirit - seemingly through the prism of his own tragic circumstances.

This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war.Author Randy Shilts tells the story of all-night all-day playgrounds on America's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses.  AIDS wasn't the gay plague, Shilts reports.  It was the 4th or 5th gay plague, nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of Stonewall's closet.  Gay sexual activists took it for granted, writes Shilts, that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases.  When the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early 1980s didn't magically appear, sexual athletes did what any normal hot-blooded Americans would do:  they blamed Reagan.Mr. Shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game.  His scorn for bath house behaviors  for blood banks is loud  clear; cheap-shotting of Reagan is muted.  Reagan, after all, had other wars and a rocky post-Carter economy on his hands.  By the time Mr. Shilts' book became a tv mini-movie, however, Reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain.  If only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name, thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved ... after all, we are now told, we all have AIDS.

Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a \\\"gay disease.\\\" Gay men didn't want to discuss that it \\\"might\\\" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable.

The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not.In between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years.Because the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain.  Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared.Rock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer!But even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind.The bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus.And, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death.Shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's.On the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity.\"},\"929\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"I teach practical Game Theory for executives.

Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans.

He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears.While I agree that he can be classified as a conservative, I would also note that this is not a \\\"conservative's conservative\\\" book.  By that I mean that people who are unabashedly Republican,  Religious Right, etc., will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history.  While Johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures, he does so on a case-by-case basis, always aiming to support his evaluations with fact.  In many instances, these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks.  They are not, however, smelling of the party line.Indeed, Johnson's book is fascinating for his historical scholarship, research, and deep analysis.  His coverage of \\\"forgotten\\\" spans of time (i.e. Grant, Arthur, Hayes, Garfield) is welcome, as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage (i.e. Lincoln, JFK).  I found the 1860-1900 chapters to be personally most enlightening.Johnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life.

I particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the Nixon and Coolidge presidency and his criticisms of JFK.

It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the \\\"Rifle-text\\\", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the \\\"ages\\\" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad  twisted \\\"love story\\\" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah  Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, \\\"...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?\\\"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers  Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful  worthwhile), but here in the most \\\"modern\\\" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints  clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which \\\"voices\\\" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to  for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later.Next up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt?  From what I understand this will be about the Hopi  Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970's-1980's.  Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip  The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century.  And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians.  Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can't wait - Vollmann's dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various \\\"Ages\\\" of our North American continent.\"},\"950\":{\"category\":\"book\",\"text\":\"I enjoyed reading the Rifles quite a bit.  That being said, it was not quite up to par with the Ice Shirt.  The plight of the native people of Northern Canada (it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves) is not something one usually reads about.  While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the \\\"great white explorers\\\" and have little to do with those living there.

New people, names,histories, and unique grammar reflective to  the period. A truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice, Vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears, but since each is complete in itself, that does not matter.

Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you.

The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing.  The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control.  The humor still abounds.  The language is easier to read but no less descriptive.

Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change.  With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen.

Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story.  While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side.  I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts.  Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated.

On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. (\\\"Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!\\\") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are \\\"right-o, jolly-good\\\" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with.

Fallaci quotes Denis Diderot's accurate description of Islam as \\\"the enemy of reason.\\\"  The anti-intellectualism and contempt for secular learning pervading the religion of Mohammed cannot be disputed.  What has the Muslim world accomplished in the last 400-500 years?  Will its more militant adherents return us to the misery of the 8th Century?   Are there any life affirming moderate Muslims?
