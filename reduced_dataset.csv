0,dvd,Great visual of the battle where my great grandfather fought with the 6th SC.  Entertaining and educational
1,dvd,"There is no questioning this film is done very well. That said, it should be pointed out that it may not be for everyone. If you are not a fan of cliches, stay away from this. There are TONS of monologues that go on for long periods of time with epic music in the background, and maybe not everyone can handle that. Most of the performances are incredible, my favorite happens to be Jeff Daniels. One performance that doesn't do it for me is Martin Sheen. He shares a lot of scenes with Tom Berenger and it seems like Berenger is the one keeping those scenes afloat. C. Thomas Howell has a steady part but you won't recognize him as the kid from the Outsiders. Great battle scenes, especially the big one in the open field at the end."
2,dvd,"After the heart-rending nobility of Abraham Lincoln's verbal tribute to Gettysburg's fallen, there is not much else that could do those men justice.Yet GETTYSBURG does so.This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history.A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle.Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College.The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance.This one is for seeing again and again, remembering, and bowing one's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood"
3,dvd,"If you're into the Civil War, this is the movie for you.  It tells the battle from both sides.  It follows the activities of both sides.   This is a must have for fans of the Civil War"
4,dvd,"This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in ""Gods and Generals"", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case.I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end"
5,dvd,"Almost a complete scope of the battle of the size of the battle in numbers and cause. Would have like to have heard Lincoln'sAddress at the end for now it is a rememberance of the dead ofboth sides of the battle that, I think, unitesw  us now intothis great nation"
6,dvd,"This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle.  I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.    Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.  These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows.     As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class.  When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time.  Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie.Read The Killer Angels and then see this outstanding movie.Kyle Prat"
7,dvd,"Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious  saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film"
8,dvd,"Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it.I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say ""I hated the ending, very predictable"" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out.If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews.If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie. But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film"
9,dvd,"I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.But still a great movie"
10,dvd,"I once thought I was almost alone in liking this creepy and fun 2004 film, but the fact is it seems to be growing on people. It just took a while for those who emerged from theaters declaring The Village a two-hour life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise. (No, I won't give it away, even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is, but if you don't know, be careful about reading any farther.) What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful  experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding. Never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand. I liked The Village from the first day I saw it, and continue to think well of it even now"
11,dvd,"The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho"
12,dvd,"This movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have everwasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, ""So What?"" Don't waste your money!"
13,dvd,"if you are expecting to be scared out of your pants - don't - this movie is not scary but more suspenseful. it is a great movie, with awesome twists and anyone who said that they figured out this movie is a liar. this movie is perfectly written, acted and directed. see this movie"
14,dvd,"It's strange; this just came on FX, and once it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing, even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around. Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with ""Lady In The Water"" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like ""Hostel"" and those damned ""Saw"" movies (enough, already)! At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like ""The Exorcist"" - if that's what you want, buy and watch ""The Exorcist"". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time"
15,dvd,I knew the ending within the first 10 minutes.  M. Night Shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at Denny's
16,dvd,"It was a delight to see this childhood memory again, and in pristine quality with color (if you prefer it in original black  white, turn the color down on your tv set). It brings this 60s series to a whole new generation of fans (my nephews  nieces wouldn't watch it in b)"
17,dvd,"I'm not reviewing the show itself, but rather the colorization. (If you've seen the show, you know whether you like it; if you haven't seen it, you can read the many other reviews.) The show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously, but if I'm bothered by the colorization, it must be really bad. Unless you like Jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they've drunk a bottle of ink, skip this version and get the BW set.  Then you won't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors"
18,dvd,"There was something special about the first season.And this has been colorized,and it realy is great the way they did that.There was a few moments you could tell it was a bit fake,but accross the board it realy has been a great effort to get it looking like this.And if you dont like the color version,simply turn off the color on your TV!The pilot episode is a personal favorite of mine how it got things started.Especially that bit when she came out of Toney's room with that long shirt!Oh those thigh's!Amazingly Barbera Eden got pregnant during this season,and had to wear an extra veil to cover up her pregnancy.I have been in love with that woman since i was about 5"
19,dvd," Like ""lighten up already 2"" said in the review of this DVD, I want historical accruacy. I wrote my opinions of the colorized versions of vintage B shows in a review of Bewitched the Complete Second Season, which is available in a colorized version. To summarize that review, would an antique dealer ruin a valuable, antique, mahogany, piece of furniture by painting it a bright red ?  "
20,dvd,"This is one of my all time favorite tv shows. Although same in concept and scope than Bewitched, this shows superior cast and performances tower over Bewitched. I believe this show was much more funnier than Bewitched. Barbara Eden stars as Jeannie and Larry Hagman stars as Cap.(later Maj.) Anthony Nelson. And Bill Daily stars as Roger Healy, Maj. Nelsons best friend.  This dvd set covers the entire 1st season (30 episodes) of the series. Since this series 1st season was shot in black and white, this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set. As far as the video and audio go, the video looks fantastic. Episodes are clean and sharp with no compression. No dirt or scratches noticeable. Audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound. All episodes are complete and uncut. The pilot episode includes a audio commentary with Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily. It's nice and pleasant but not very informative. This is the main problem I have about this set. NO INFORMATION!! To me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars. The 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes. On the back of the cases you get episode #, title of each episode, and small description of each one. I think there should be more info than this, so I had hoped when I played the dvds, got to the main menu, and selected an episode, I would get a small amount of trivia, some more details such as  production date, 1st broadcast date, and cast listing with special guest stars. No such luck. I had hoped for much more info about each episode. You get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagmen, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily, which is a nice (but short) special feature. It's nice to see them together and still very good friends. They were the backbone of this great show (along with the late Hayden Roarke). Hayden Roarke was wonderful as Dr. Alfred Bellows. I would have loved for him to have been there too. In closing this is still a great set to have, and I intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show. I highly recommend the b+w dvd version of this classic show"
21,dvd,"I love i dream of jeannie, it's just so wholesome and entertaining at the same time. The only thing I wish they've included in the DVD is English subtitles. Sometimes if you've missed what the characters are saying at least you can always check the subtitles. But other than that I'm very glad they've put the series out on DVD."
22,dvd,"I'm waiting for the release of Season 3 - the best one! This is where Jeannie's evil dark-haired sister shows up for the first time. So silly, so much fun, sweet memories .."
23,dvd,"Finally, another of my favorite sitcoms is released on DVD!I've enjoyed watching re-run after re-run of this ""gem"" ofa series for years. For quite awhile the first season wasnot even a part of the syndicated episodes.Barbara Eden is fantastic as Jeannie. Poor Tony Nelsondidn't realize how lucky he really was!Larry Hagman played the part of Anthony Nelson with greatcomedic timing. Larry and Barbara together made a fantasticteam!I love the interviews with Barbara, Larry and Bill Daily.Even today, the three of them come across as best friends.It's no wonder they were so good together in the series!I Dream Of Jeannie will always be one of the funniest showsever to grace our TV screens!I'm not thrilled about the movie version soon to be released-I'll stick with what is best-THE ORIGINAL!Now I will wait for one more of my favorite shows-THE PATTYDUKE SHOW"
24,dvd,Wonderful shows/episodes.  My favorite sitcom.  I wish that they played I dream of Jeannie on the television at prime time instead of the junk they have now. You do not have to monitor this program.  It is one that almost any age can enjoy.
25,dvd,"As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories.  The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona.  This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's.  Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960.  The people were wonderful to grow up with.  This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer.  I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD.  I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts.  Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating"
26,dvd,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, ""OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance."" ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time"
27,dvd,"Love this movie, caught some of it on TV one week so then did a search on Amazon and brought the movie. Family entertainment Loosly based on the real life Frank T Hopkins who did more to save the wild Mustang than any other"
28,dvd,"Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all.  Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the ""Ocean of Fire"" in the 1890's.This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver.  The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a ""cowboy'.  We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke.  And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American.  This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins.Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world.  When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life.Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity.  Viggo must have definitely ""lived"" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them.  He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing.  Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series.  This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance.  Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover."
29,dvd,"Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the ""Ocean of Fire"".Highly Recommended"
30,dvd,"The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.  In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up"
31,dvd,"In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character.  Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant.  What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted.Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider.  He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years.  After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East.A side note.  The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre.  The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank.  I will discuss these distractions more later in this review.This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins.  Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race.  Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race.  Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts.  He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger.  Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining.The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo.  Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character.  Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie.  Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie.The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions.  I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race.  Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were.  I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring.  Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions.  The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly.I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins.  Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest."
32,dvd,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.  It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed.  This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint.  If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it.  And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him.  He is a very good actor and an underated one at that.  So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure.  And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!!"
33,dvd,"Here's an ""epic"" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as ""The Mummy."" Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.Frankly, I thought the ""slow"" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word.On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as ""Hidalgo"" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family"
34,dvd,"This is a very entertaining movie with the horse stealing the show, of course.  I also like that it is based on a real person."
35,dvd,"My daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and don't like it.  They also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it.  My 9 yr. old especially likes the tae bo better.  I bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout, but they don't want to do this one at all.  I thought they would, and I'm sure as the other reviews have stated, love it but they didn't.  I guess it just depends on the child"
36,dvd,"Great workout for our kids  us parents too....simple to follow, very effective, and our 4 kids from baby to pre-teen jump in and kick.  The coach is very optimistic and positive.  I also like the extra defense techniques shown to children.   It was very much worth the money....especially good on Rainy and Snowy Days"
37,dvd,Wish this vid had another workout. Amazing interest at first. Got old quickly
38,dvd,"I would highly recommend this video if you are looking for something to motivate kids and that they can keep up with and have fun but still get a good work-out.  It is based on martial arts but does not include violence toward other people.  Instead, he picks apples and oranges and kicks soccer balls.  The video is also split up (for example, Warm Up and Cool Down) so it is easy to pause and grab a drink of water if you need one. "
39,dvd,"My kids absolutly LOVE this program. The children on the program are clearly having fun, which makes it so much more fun for the viewer, especially when the viewers are children themselves. The guy leading the group is just awesome with kids. He interacts with them throughout the entire program, and really makes it a lot of fun. My kids have seen their share of kid's exercise programs, and until we saw this one, they weren't very happy with any of them. This program really makes them feel good about themselves, and really makes them feel good about exercising. I have seen this video in the #1 spot for quite a while, but because it was priced a little higher than some of the other videos, I thought I would save a few dollars  try them instead. - BIG MISTAKE!!! NOW I wish I would have bought this video first, and saved the money I spent on the other videos.  Kick to Get Fit Jr. - for kids is truly worth the few extra dollars. _ This is difinitely a case where you get what you have paid for. A few extra dollars = a much better product. - Atleast in this case it does!"
40,dvd,"I bought this mainly for my 7 yr old son, but even the older children I care for (I run a family daycare) really enjoy this. All the kids give it two thumbs way up."
41,dvd,"I purchased this for my 4-year-old son, and we love it.  The moves are very easy to follow and extremely non-violent.  He compares the martial arts moves to picking apples and oranges versus upper cuts and jabs.  The kids in the video are just kids -- they don't perform everything perfectly so as not to make your little feel incompetent.  Great for all ages"
42,dvd,"This program is simply the best kid's program I've ever seen. I really can't say a lot that hasn't already been said in other reviews, I just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is.- A couple of quick points that make this program so special are; the instructor, the program itself, and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having, and the amount of fun my children have doing the program. - The instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program, and also to the viewers at home. He is funny, but yet professional with his instruction, and really does a good job with the kids. - The program itself is like nothing I've ever seen before, the movements are a combination of karate techniques (with a non-violent approach), aerobic movements, and basic physical education activities, it's a very nice blend, and it really flows together well. - And last, but certainly not least, this program is FUN to do, and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with.This is terrific program"
43,dvd,"This program is simply the best kid's exercise video I've seen - PERIOD!!!!I usually don't write reviews, simple because most of the kid's fitness programs I've seen aren't worth the time to write about. But, Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, is completely different than anything I've ever seen. The film quality was very good, and the instructor did such a great job interacting with the kids, he's truly a natural with kids. One of the things I liked best about this program was the tempo  flow, and the way the instructor just seemed to flow with the program. What I mean is, it didn't appear that he had  memorized a script (of what to say) or that he was reading word for word from a script, he just went with the flow. And, any one of us who has ever worked with kids before knows that you have to be natural with kids in order to make it fun, anything less than that will effect the quality of what you're doing. - Now, don't get me wrong, this program was well rehearsed  extremely well put together, but the instructor  kids were truly going with the flow  having fun. - Which is definitely more appealing to the kids watching the program. - Kids enjoy watching kids having fun, and if the kids on the program are having fun, then the kids watching want to participate so that they can have just as much fun. It doesn't get much simpler than this, unfortunately most programs have no understanding of this concept and fall way short.Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids is simply the best! Check it out, your kids will love it."
44,dvd,"One of the best movies I've seen.  Everybody does a great job in portraying this sensitive material in a very real and gutsy way.  I've seen this movie three times, I think, and each time have found it not only entertaining, but reminding that, as a society, we still have a lot of work to do on healing our human need for hatred and fear"
45,dvd,"Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies"
46,dvd,"Grisham once said he wrote his other books, e.g., The Firm, et al., so he could afford to write important books, like this one, upon which the movie s based.  Matthew McConaghey gives a fantastic performance--and why hasn't Hollywood ever--EVER--given him another part this good!  Thought provoking, great acting, great story, highly recommen"
47,dvd,If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you.  It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause
48,dvd,"With a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit...I found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me...this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers.  The story is a brutally honest one about racism in Mississippi in the year 1995.  A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held.  The film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly, Jake (McConaughey) as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed KKK as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty.  The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined.  Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through.  Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Keifer  Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd and Chris Cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast"
49,dvd,"     THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you.      A Time to kill's plot is pretty simply explained.  In the deep south, a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks, who almost kill her. A young white lawyer and father (Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance) is sickened at the news, and doesn't quite know what to think when the little girl's father (Sammuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey) pays him a visit and asks if he'd ""help him if he were in a tight spot"".  The next day as the two redneck/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment, Carl Lee Hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher.     Jake Brigance agrees to defend Hailey as his murder trial begins. The insanity plea is used to ""give the jury an excuse to aquit"" But in my opinion, I think it was quite legitimate. What father WOULDN't be driven insane under the circumstances?  the rest of the movie is Carl Lee Hailey's trial and the surrounding Drama as KKK violence emerges led by Kiefer Sutherland, and Jake's life and home are in danger, his relationship with his wife strained, and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle.        My favorite scene? It might come as a surprise, but my favorite scene is when the Prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial. He was caught in the knee by a stray bullet, and now has half a leg.  After the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against Carl Lee, and establish unerring identity of the shooter, The Defence asks him two questions. ""Do you think Carl Lee intentionally shot you?"" ""No"" ""Do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did?""""He did what I would have done.""but it doesn't end there as the Policeman (remember he's missing a leg because of what Carl Lee Hailey Did) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like Carl Lee did. He starts screaming to the jury to ""turn him loose, He's a hero!""  I think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes (albeit there are many others too) (Great acting by Chris Cooper as the policeman) Anyway.. forgive if I rambled. I love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas... star studded casts.. John Grisham...suspense thrillers..just all around good movies.. You need to see this."
50,dvd,"Every writer is important. A writer that has views, characters, and exciting trial cases. This movie is originally based off of john grisim's first novel. A novel that he sturggled to get out there and then finally had it self-published. It's a powerful story that has a very dark setting. There's rascism, there's fights, there's deaths. Everything that this wolrd wants to avoid. I think samuel jackson played a really powerful performacne and I hope he got an oscar for this role. Just to warn you, though, that there are images in here that are hard to see. I , myself, fastforwarded one scene because I couldn't handle it. It's near the begining. But I hope you people enjoy the cast of characters and get captured by this huge story"
51,dvd,"This is by far John Grisham's best books and movies of all. Although this was John's first book, it wasn't successful until one of more of his other books became successful. After the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list. Then comes the subject of making this book into a movie. When John Grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie, he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive. He felt that without his input, the movie could not reflect what Grisham was trying to present in the book. After several of John Grisham's books were made into movies and were successful, I knew it was only a matter of time before ""A Time To Kill"" would be on the big screen. This movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because John Grisham had some influence over the production. The movie has an all star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. This movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years. This DVD should be apart of everyone's movie collection. As this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come, the movie will also be."
52,dvd,"John Grisham's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the South  was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by Joel Schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman.  The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit.Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility.  Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias. Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 0"
53,dvd,"John Grisham's novel, ""A Time to Kill"" is closly adapted into a major motion picture by director Joel Schumacher.  Rated ""R"" for language and violent content (including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl), the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of ""A"" list stars.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment.  Young and inexperienced local attorney, Jake Brigance (played by Matthew McConaughey in one of his first major roles) agrees to defend Carl Lee against the smarmey District Attroney Rufus Buckley (played by Kevin Spacey).  Brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of Sandra Bullock (playing a well-to-do law student), Oliver Platt (a morally devoid divorce attorney) and Donald Sutherland (a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave Brigance his first job).  As the plot builds, the community begins to takes sides in the case.  The KKK is called in to intimidate Carl Lee's defense team and the NAACP enters to counteract the Klan's actions.In some reviews, the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable.  This reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book.  Without revealing any key plot details, let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the Deep South in a accurate way.  There's plenty of action, few down moments and sparkling performances by a great cast!  If you liked the book, you will enjoy ""A Time to Kill""."
54,dvd,My three grandchildren (ages 5 through 10) love this DVD. They watch it in the van when they ride with me and are having so much fun learning the songs that they don't even think about how much they are learning
55,dvd,"I grew up with this, and now my 6 year old will have the opportunity to learn as I did. This was a kick to watch, for both of us, from start to finish. This would be a great gift for anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s, and for their kids. The tune, ""I'm only a bill...."" is stuck in my head right now"
56,dvd,"I really love this DVD. It's wonderful having all the 'rocks'in one place! You can play them linearly, or randomly, or by category. I'm enjoying the heck out of it ... and I'm almost sixty! (Supposedly I bought it for my autistic son. He loves it too."
57,dvd,"My son is 6 and I bought this for him to help him prep for 1st grade. He loves it and watches it every morning before school. He chooses to watch it over Nickelodeon and CN. After he watches one or two videos, we discuss them and later, we sing them. He has already learned heaps of math, grammar and US history. The latter is important because we live in Japan and I'm trying to see that he learns about his ""other"" nation. I also want to see him maintain his English as the school system pours more and more Japanese on him. School House Rock achieves all of these goals and more. The 2 disk set is also well-designed, with alot of extra animations. This is a must-have for any school-aged child, and as a GenX-er I never get tired of watching it, either. Solid, show-quality songs. Engaging, funny animation"
58,dvd,Another generation is now able to enjoy and learn
59,dvd,"Years ago, I used to watch Schoolhouse Rock with my children and recommended it to my students as well. Today, it is entertaining and educating the next generation of our family's youngsters. The Special 30th Anniversary Edition will be a treasure that parents and grandparents can enjoy with the kids. It's money well-spent"
60,dvd,"This series of short videos is a great tool for parents to teach their kids various topics, English/Grammar, Math, How our form of Government (should) work, and History.  I remember it well"
61,dvd,"Finally, every one of the Schoolhouse Rock -- as well as a few I don't remember"
62,dvd,"This is a good video for kids.  It worked for me along time ago.  I learned the preamble from this video and to this day if I need to recite the preamble I sing it.  Not only the preamble, you learn spanish, bill to a law, conjunctions.... this video is timeless.If you have kids get this for them, makes at least the basics for 5 subjects in school easier for them"
63,dvd,"For those of you whose children grew up with ""Conjunction Junction"" and other Grammar Rock songs, it is probably  time for you to buy this DVD set for your grandkids! This collection has all of the songs that you remember (and probably some that you don't!) I recommend playing it on your computer for easier navigation to the videos that you want to see. I do not recommend downloading the software that comes with it. It was quite difficult to navigate. Simply use the media viewer that you already have installed on your computer. I really give this product 5 Stars; the 2 star rating was an accident that I can't remedy."
64,dvd,Everyone in our family loves this movie.  It's a great anytime movie
65,dvd,got it fast and my son was really happy. amazon is very reliable. i'm happy that i got it through them. keep up the good work
66,dvd,"The story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled ""drink me"" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing ""Alice in Wonderland"" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches ""Fantasia"" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!"
67,dvd,"Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorite animated films. Some great characters in this one, the smoking caterpillar, chesire cat, the queen of hearts, the mad hatter, and of course that busy White Rabbit. Alice in Wonderland is such a sweet, sensitive and quite risque film, clearly the caterpillar isn't smoking incense but this film is classic, I love it so much. I can't wait til my nephew starts watching this film. Other Disney films I enjoy include: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and The Lady and the Tramp. I highly recommend Alice in Wonderland, could this movie be any better? I think not"
68,dvd,"Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is one of their most underrated animated masterpieces that finally gets the 2 disc special edition treatment that it so very much deserves.  The animation is pleasing to the eyes, the songs are pleasing to the ears, and Alice's adventures are charming and interesting to behold.  The classic childhood story written my Lewis Carroll, is given a brilliant boost with great animated characters that bring Alice's adventures to glorious life.  Kathryn Beaumont give's Alice a voice that is so sincere with each amazing discovery in the Land of Wonder, so that the character seems more real than simply animated.  Kathryn also does a great job as the voice for Wendy in Disney's ""Peter Pan.""  This dvd release is loaded with tons of extras that are very enjoyable to watch.   I especially like the Walt Disney tv special, starring Kathryn Beaumont and Bobby Driscoll (Treasure Island) that introduces ""Alice in Wonderland"" to the public and features excerpts from ""Song of the South"" and other Disney films.  I highly recommend ""Alice in Wonderland : The Masterpiece Edition"" to fans of classic Disney animated films and to fans of animated childhood stories and fantasies.  ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a beautiful daydream that definitely should not be missed"
69,dvd,"Not only does this film was exquisitely made for a different audience by Disney, but they were able to capture the real message implicitly stated in Carrol's book; here, we are able to succumb into the fantastic wonderlands brought upon by psychedelics, and more often than not, one is constantly reminded about the useless games and parodies we set ourselves with on a daily basis. Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind. Most importantly, I believe, is to watch this film under a preferred state of consciousness as to better appreciate the subtle messages the producers wanted to put across, and luckily, by the end of the film, you can ask yourself: Who am I?"
70,dvd,"There's certain sequences in Disney films that are so memorable they tend to get parodied or they're referenced more than the actual movie. The spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp. Bambi's mother in that movie, or the pink elephant scene in Dumbo are examples of scenes that are just as memorable as the films. So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie.Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water. She follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of Wonderland. She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit.Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down.This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different. While those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song, Alice has a bunch of songs. The imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils, talking flowers, tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing. You can obviously tell why critics couldn't understand it. It's still cited as one of Disney's more better ""smart"" films such as Fantasia.You should check it out? Of course but word of caution: by no means are you going to see a quintessential Disney classic but still you'll probably like it and enjoy it...probably"
71,dvd,i loved this movie-it is a thinkers movie-not fluff or gore
72,dvd,"I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie  Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself ""do I really like these two?"" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding ""YES!""The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like ""oh so he/she did it...interesting""...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling"
73,dvd,"I was very pleasantly surprised at this film. Denzel Washington proves again that he can handle any role that he chooses to play. In this case, he plays homicide inspector, Lincoln Rhyme who has been nearly paralyzed after suffering from an accident in the line of duty. But now, when a mysterious killer begins killing off people in a very peculiar matter, he must team with a hard-headed rookie cop (Angelina Jolie) to solve the crimes. Supporting cast includes Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman, Leland Orser and Ed O'Neil. I like the way they have the killer as an intelligent person. Someone who has a knowledge of what he is doing. And the way he leaves clues for the cops to follow. To come up with something this perfect, you must a genius. While not really scary, this suspense thriller is actually thrilling as opposed to the many number of ""thrillers"" that are not even thrilling. (Example: HANGMAN). Thank you Hollywood for giving us THE BONE COLLECTOR. This is a good one. Highly recommended.....5/"
74,dvd,"Philip Noyce is a very smart filmmaker. And once more he confirms it through this intense and intriguing psychological picture around a notable expert forensic (Denzel Washington)  sadly a bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces with a witty female agent (Angelina Jollie) to intend by all their means to get a mysterious serial killer around the low belly of NYC.Smart clues, notable shots, first rate direction, kinetic script make of this movie one of the five most solid thrillers in the Nineties according the tradition of Silence of the lambs as well as an underneath homage to ""The rear window"", if you carefully establish the visible connections, due if James Stewart was a visible peeping tom at those times, Denzel Washington is the scrutinizing cyber eye. The paradigm remains, and just the form changes. Highly recommended. "
75,dvd,Very interested and keeps you on the 'edge' thru the entire movie!
76,dvd,"Bone CollectorUpon the opening scene of the movie, I was highly upset.  It was only after the movie had begun that I realized I didn't buy a porn.  C'mon!  Bone Collector!?  That was a clever little marketing ruse you did there Universal.  Nice one.  You won't get me again.It's a psycho-sexual thriller, with Angelina Jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles, nuts and bolts, and jigsaw puzzles.  This guy is so smart he could probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy.  He even has an awesome, magical straw that controls one of those Tempur-pedic beds.  He can make the bed recline with a magic straw!!  Unfortunately, he didn't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick.Together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of, Jolie (who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something) begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses, clues, comic books, and ancient steam pipes, leading to a super-duper surprise hunky-dory ending in which everything is perfect, and butterflies land on retarded kids' heads.  Only, there are a few major plot-holes:1)	There is no way that Jolie would have switched departments.2)	There is no way that Washington would have had that much pull.3)	There is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with.4)	The clues that are so cleverly figured out don't even lead to figuring out who the killer is.Things learned from this movie: -Ed O'Neill is more versatile than the Al Bundy role.  -Make sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an Arab guy.-I hate the fact that Queen Latifah, a person as talented as a stick of butter, has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity.  The fifteen minutes have been over for quite some time now.  Leave.In the end it's a mediocre movie from which I expected more.  Given the combo of Washington and Jolie, there really should have been greatness.  It's a preposterous renter at best"
77,dvd,"This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it. Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project."
78,dvd,"I really enjoy the House of Elliot. The series starts off well with two sisters going into the dress-making business and opening up their own successful shop. Season 2 ditches some of the old villains (the scheming relatives) and introduces a French designer and a banker as the antagonist/s of the season.Again, as with the first series, I like the character Bea a bit more than I like Evie. Evie's antics don't really excite me that much. She seems the more selfish and inconsiderate of the two. I also don't find myself enraptured by the Jack/Bea romance. While I enjoy both characters individually, I see Bea as too independent to settle down and become the perfect wife. Also, I don't really care that much about the film industry, so watching Jack 'on the job' doesn't hold that much appeal.Still, this was a solid season and its nice to see the sisters be successful for once"
79,dvd,"Any word on if/when Series 4 of The House of Eliott will be released on DVD?  I, too, found the last episode of Series 3 to be quite a cliff-hanger and I would surely be looking forward to seeing what happens to Jack in Parliament as well as how Evie will fight for her couturier part in the design house.Any word would be appreciated"
80,dvd,"I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of the House of Eliott.  The acting was fantastic, the dresses magnificent and the locations, as with most English mini-series, marvelous.  My only complaint is that it doesn't end!!  THere is no closure to this.  As you approach the last chapter of Season 3 you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left, and - oh surprise! - things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone!  Is there any chance that there is a Season 4 out there somewhere????"
81,dvd,"I greatly enjoyed both Series 1 and 2.  The costumes are spectular.  The plot can be a little tedious at times, but there is an impressive cast of different characters coming and going throughout the series.  It's also pleasantly predictable, so a lot of fun.  My only complaint is that the last episode is a mild cliff hanger, and later episodes aren't available.  My compliments to amazon.com for carrying these reviews.  It was the only place I found that indicated that there are more episodes to come on DVD.  Not even the BBC.UK website provided that information!  Thanks, Amazon and volunteer reviewers"
82,dvd,"wonderful series,hope they bring out the thirdone soon,loved i"
83,dvd,"Hilarious from beginning to end!  Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me???? "
84,dvd,"Yes, it is that funny.  The humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP, in which Christopher Guest costarred, and predecessor to Guest's later masterpieces BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND.  Reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre, in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary.  Guest has in three films now masterfully emulated Reiner's style, assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again.  Almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three.Unless one prefers dumbed-down slapstick, this is comedy just about as funny as it comes.  The first time I saw it I don't think I really caught on until the scene where Blaine, Missouri's (the film was actually filmed in Texas) town historian recounted how Blaine was founded after wagon train leader Blaine Fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in California near the Pacific when in fact they were in Missouri.  The plot is rather simple.  In honor of the 150th anniversary of Blaine's inadvertent founding, a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue.  Corky St. Clair, an obviously gay theater person who has fled New York for the small town, takes on the challenge of directing.  The bulk of the movie consists of auditions, rehearsals, and the final performance of the musical.  The title stems from the hope that a Mr. Guffman of a New York theatrical company will be in attendance.  This film was literally made up as they went along.  My understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which Guest had to craft a final film.  While move films are refined in the editing phase, this one is unique for being created at that stage.  Because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll, a film like this takes a special cast of actors.  Veterans of improv like Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy and stand ups such as Fred Willard are to be expected, but what is so great is how people you wouldn't automatically think would excel in the form, such as the always delightful Parker Posey, do so.  By way of trivia, the part of the play's narrator is played by Lewis Arquette, son of Cliff Arquette and father of all those other Arquettes, including Rosanna, Patricia, and David.  And I'm sure all ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fans will love the UFO expert, played by none other than Tobias himself, David Cross (famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show).One of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a ""Three Months Later"" coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up.  Corky is back in New York, hoping for tryouts (perhaps as Henry Higgins in a revival of MY FAIR LADY).  The joke comes when we find out he is running a Hollywood memorabilia store, where one of the hottest items is a MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action figure set.  For those who haven't seen the film, the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is Wallace and Andre talk while seated in a restaurant.I've learned the hard way that this and Guest's other films aren't for everybody.  Not everyone seems to ""get"" them.  This astonishes me since I find these films funnier than anything else coming out of Hollywood these days.  But for whatever reason, so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them.  But for those who are, these films are priceless gems"
85,dvd,"Apparently this is one of those ""cult"" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits. ""Waiting for Guffman"" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the ""funniest movie ever"" or ""hilarious"" is definitely out of the mainstream.I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS. OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of ""not helpful"" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find ""Waiting for Guffman"" very amusing"
86,dvd,"This is a really great and hilarious movie. If you're a Christopher Guest fan, and you like ""Spinal Tap"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", you'll love this one as well.  It's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies, like Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, and they're all always great together.  Also, David Cross is hilarious as the UFO nut.Definitely buy this movie.  And don't forget to pick up a ""Remains of the Day"" lunchbox while you're at it"
87,dvd,"If you have ever been involved in any sort of community or college theater, you have GOT to see this film. There is great truth in this fiction"
88,dvd,"Waiting for Guffman is an awesomely funny movie!  It's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot - awkward transitions, bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action.  The characters are wonderful.  Guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the over-exuberant Blaine Community Players.  The movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty, thoughtful humor as well.What's great about this movie as well is that you're not just laughing at the characters, you're getting excited about the Blaine Sesquecentennial right along with them!  The songs are catchy (in a frighteningly annoying kind of way), and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review.  If you have seen other Guest movies, I would say this one ranks in the middle for me (Best in Show is my favorite, Waiting for Guffman, then A Mighty Wind).  I think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of small-town pride and revelry.  Loved it!  Favorite line: ""I hate you, you... bastard people...  You're all bastard people!"
89,dvd,This movie is just plain hilarious. If you have ever known people who fancy themselves members of the creative elite BUY THIS DVD. The endless laughs will make up for all the suffering pretentious types have ever put you through. That's a bargain at any price
90,dvd,"Having known a few people who fancy themselves as creative types , it was a fun experience to watch this . One could argue that this misguided feeling that people have is one of the main concerns of Christopher Guest - it may be a limited view of people , but it is also a predominant problem for most of us .I would feel confident in saying that many of us have had to deal with a colleague who thinks they are wonderful . I don't mind that so much . For me , the problem comes when those types are put in charge of a group of people .This film can be seen as a comedy or as a good example of putting together a group of people who are more than a little self-centred . You will see the psychological game playing going on . It is a film for anyone who has ever been involved with amateur dramatics , or amateur anything .You will notice that Mr Guest has made a number of other films like this and they are all entertaining . I encourage you to see them all for the characters - the rich tapestry of humanity we all deal with every day"
91,dvd,"I think that for a first time writer/director Vanessa did a great job.  The story is based on her real family to some extent and the town she grew up in, which is VERY similar to the film and the movie was filmed there as well.  It's a movie about family like nobody could ever imagine.  This family is real, and i know them all because they are my family as well.  Others say this family is impossible to exist but THEY DO......slightly less dramatic but its all there.  I think it's great"
92,dvd,"Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.  In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.  "
93,dvd,"Character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device.  However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones.  We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters.  Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable.  We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else.  For a much better ""quirky family"" movie, wait for ""The Family Stone"" to come out on DVD"
94,dvd,"This is how that ""Greek Wedding"" movie should have been done! Its sweet without being schmaltzie. Its gritty without losing heart. I like to think of this film as that ""other wedding film"" on ecstasy (in a very flattering way). It was written, produced, directed, and starred the very talented Vanessa Parise. Keep your eye on this young woman folks, she is going places"
95,dvd,"Sibling rivalry. An overbearing father. Great Italian food. Small town versus big city life. Family bonds. Life choices. Handsome men. Four beautiful sisters. So much to relate to. Emotional, fun and definitely worth buying"
96,dvd,"I laughed, I cried.  So entertaining -- loved it.  We need more movies like this one.  I want to see it on the big screen"
97,dvd,I thought this was a chick flick but i actually really liked it
98,dvd,"I'm usually not into reality tv shows (never watched one for more than one episode) however, when i started watching the apprentice i immediately became addicted to it. It is by far the best reality show ever created. Not only its entertaining but most importantly, its educational. It gives the viewers a chance to see and experience secondhand many aspects of many types of businesses and how people from different backgrounds work together (or not)...Also, Trump shares so much of his knowledge in doing business that just those insights are enough reason to buy this dvd...Highly recommended!"
99,dvd,"I bought this product for a business training program.  Many of our associates where not aware of the winner and what his business message offers.  This product was great as a learning tool with an added bonus of ""no commercials"""
100,dvd,"The Apprentice Season 5 is being shown on Hong Kong TV each Monday and I can't believe both my 15-year-old son and I have arranged our social schedules around this one-hr TV show on Monday evening.   We are absolutely hooked on it and can hardly wait for the next episode.   Why does it take so long for Season 2,3 and 4 to come out in DVD?    This is an ideal gift for anyone with good taste for a good TV serial.  "
101,dvd,"'The Apprentice' should hardly be evaluated as the underdog of reality television.  Slickly, but sharply presented, it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that can't fail to enthrall a NYSE broker or an unfamiliar novice.  The elements are assembled expertly by 'Survivor' creator, Mark Burnett, and The Donald.  Editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success, but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama.  Alumni Bill Rancic in his autobiographical business memoir, called 'The Apprentice,' a game show.  Deference should be showed for his evaluation, but they could have fooled us.  It seems more like a simulation.  Season one comes together serendipitously for three reasons:  the task, taskmaster, and the takers.  Mystery pervades every episode with a colorful group of contestants, an assignment with a different business aspect provided, and an elimination round that is suspenseful and skillfully prepared.  (What will they have to do?  How will they get their act together?  Who will get fired?)  Then, in the middle of the episode, The Donald has a cameo appearance where he expounds on the business lesson or principal, usually highlighting a contestant's later actions.  It could have come across as a schmaltzy business lesson, but his folksy, no-nonsense lecture becomes an illuminating intermission.  Season one works well for the cast of characters.  (And, as contestants, there are plenty here!)  The first season was not just successful because of viewer curiosity, it worked because the first group had less talent and accumen and more heart and colorful personalities overall.  There was a savvy, charismatic businesswoman from Texas (Amy), a colorful cowboy from Boise (Troy), a brash, but spunky New Yorker (Heidi), a smooth and learned broker (Kwame), and a calm and hard-working entrepreneur from Chicago (Bill) just to name a few.  The serial drama seems genuine and not forced.  (The premise contained risks that could have been a disaster.)  The plot thickened with alliances that were made and broken, but more interesting was the love interest of Amy and Nick.  Both the couple and the producers captured the relationship in a way to keep it from overtaking the main story, but the presentation kept us guessing whether it was genuine love or a ploy at office politics.  Furthermore, a villain was added to the mix.  Omarossa Manigault-Stallworth--forgive me for the misspelling!--formerly worked for the Clinton administration and had the political skills to throw a wrench into everything.  She wasn't rationalizing when she said she was way too creative to take a job with Donald Trump.  On 'The Apprentice' website, she wrote that never was so much good come from being so bad.  (It turns out that she's had the most follow-up stories.  An aspiring actress, she's been successful for Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' and a UPN soap opera.  Maybe she was grooming to be the next Erica Caine/Susan Lucci all along.  In a recent book, Trump himself called her ""the most articulate"" of all the first year contestants.  I thought the same, but have to give him the credit.)  Not to spoil discoveries with details, but Nick's honesty and chauvenism, Amy's perfectionism, and Heidi's family drama are just a few developments added to keep our interest. Seldom have people on a reality show been more endearing than with this ensemble.   Upon the debut, we all became armchair quarterbacks, calling them out for dumb plays and wrongly calling out the Donald for some executive decisions.  (When he fired Omarossa, I thought he did it at the worst time, when she was at her finest form and the only one on her team to produce.  However, results are everything.  He didn't get to be a billionaire for bad judgment!  To rephrase 'SNL', ""He's The Donald.  And You're NOT!"")   And, that's where the success falls apart.  Sam correctly distinguished the difference between good candidacy and good television with his 'Apprentice' website commentary.  To paraphrase, a good strategy and engaging television can often come at cross-purposes.  True to himself, after season one Donald Trump showcased bigger clients with bigger prizes and candidates with far better resumes.  The result was a feeding frenzy.  Later seasons fostered business accumen like never before and aspiring starlets mugging for the camera.  The professionals devoured the latter.  Stacy J., for instance, was unfairly eliminated early and accused of lunacy for her vibrant, cheerleading sensibilities.  If the catclaws were apparent season one, they at least managed to put them away in time to win against the men!  Season two was bloody.  After season one the tasks were bigger but didn't showcase specific designated skills (like negotiating) for each week with each new task.  The later simulations often failed to surprise.  Later, it was harder to like the candidates.  Trump's admirable genuineness created, but later killed, the show.       "
102,dvd,"I Live in Thailand  I Dont get any American TV Programs Here so I watch a lot of TV Shows on DVD I either get from friends or buy on-line. As for this ReviewThe Apprentice is a Great Reality show. I Have Watched it over and Over again. My Only Comment is when will the rest of the Apprentice seasons come out on DVD for purshase.  It is a Shame thier is only the 1st Season out for sale.Please send me an e-mail if any future Seasons of the Apperentice do become availible on DVD thank you, Thomas Lentin"
103,dvd,"I had a great time watching the first season via this DVD set. I have seen the last two seasons and loved them but I had never seen the first season. I thought I'd get this to see how it was and I wanted to see how the first winner was, (while being a candidate). I have to say that it was amazing. I loved the whole series. The candidates were very unique and entertaining to watch. Even Mr. Trump is a little more laid back in this season than others.The bonus disk is also very fun. It has more info on the candidates, a music video, deleted scenes, career advice from Trump's advisors George and Carolyn, an exclusive sneak peak of season 2, ""Donald-isms"", unseen footage from the ending title taxi rides, new interviews with Donald Trump and the contestants, and creator Mark Burnett on The Apprentice. A lot to offer, really. I really recommend this set to those who like reality shows (like survivor). Even if you haven't seen the first season, or even if you haven't seen any of the seasons. This is really a great set.I hope to see the second season on DVD soon.--M.Turcott"
104,dvd,"I've had a lot of experience as a 'project manager' and it doesn't quite resemble the show's job description.  First and foremost this is a tv show where none of the women are overweight and are above average looking.  The men are allowed to be average looking.  Season one is by far the best. After that the show has just repeated itself and has not shown enough creative projects to keep it compelling.The personalities are the stars.  Omorosa is not a capable worker but manages to inflate her abilities.  No wonder she couldn't keep a government job.  My sister saw the season finale with me but didn't see the other episodes.  She asked what was wrong with that woman.  So true, there's no way Omorosa should have a position with responsibility.  Lucily Amy is intelligent enough to keep the show from filling it with so so business women who are of course attractive.  Kwame and Bill could have easily won and would have done well at the job.  They didn't attack each others personalities, but tried to play up their strengths.  After the 1st season it became the 'street vendor show' and then the 'create a marketing campaign for a large company.'  By the second season many candidates were fired for the wrong reasons.  The 1st season had more logic behind the firings. "
105,dvd,"I didn't start watching The Apprentice until the second season. Now I am a big fan of the show, and I look forward to each new season. I bought the Season One DVD set awhile ago, and love it! I just wish that they would now release the rest of the seasons!Trump gives great tips, that are highlighted during different times in the shows, and I always look forward to what he will say next. As successful as he is, he's definitely worth listening to!    You might think that a reality show like this would get boring over time, but this one still manages to keep us watching...and loving it! Not only is The Apprentice entertaining, but you can learn a lot from the show."
106,dvd,I bought this DVD and IT WAS THE BEST! The only thing I don't like is they are playing for a job
107,dvd,"I never watched the Apprentice when it was on TV.  I thought I wouldn't like it because I am not into business or Donald Trump.  But I ended-up checking it out from my library just to see what the big stink was about, and I was HOOKED!  I watched it all weekend, one episode after the other.  I had to know what happened!  I loved the challenges given to the contestants - it was fun to see how they would work through them.  Plus there is plenty of personal conflict and drama.  GREAT show"
108,dvd,"Frank Oz directs the best Steve Martin movies. While Michael Caine is a reliably excellent presence in most if not all of the movies he appears in, Martin (in my opinion) is uneven and all too often relies on shtick. Oz seems to bring out the best...or makes best use of the worse...in Martin's bag of tricks. Bowfinger is further evidence of this. We've (husband, wife and three kids) have seen this movie too many times to count and yet quite a few scenes never fail to make us laugh. The scene of Caine posing as famed Medical specialist testing Martin's feigned psychosomatic paralysis is priceless."
109,dvd,"This one has it all - an inspired script (Lady Fanny of Omaha?) based on a clever premise, an opportunity for Steve Martin to work a full range of schticks (including a very earnest, ""don't pity me, you don't have to do that"" ruse), a richly-photographed Riviera backdrop and a stylish jazz violin score by the late Miles Goodman. Of special note is Michael Caine's wonderful man-about-town, a role that would have been tailor-made (pun intended) for the late David Niven and executed to perfection by Caine, who is at the top of his form here. Caine and Martin playing cat-and-mouse with one another is great fun. And, oh yes, there's that over-the-top segment about Ruprecht that a friend and I have bantered about for years.Top-notch entertainment.  "
110,dvd,"So many hysterical scenes that make everyone I watch it with laugh.  The ending is one that I can only aspire too, and I can't give it away!  However, I will say that watching con artists con eachother is on par with watching Josh Holloway trying to portray ""Sawyer"" his con-artist through the TV series Lost.  Enjoy"
111,dvd,This movie will make you laugh from beginning to end!  I have watched it several times and still laugh out loud.  Highly recommeded for fans of Michael Cane and Steve Martin
112,dvd,"""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is a classic comedy, driven from beginning to end by the crafty characters created by Michael Caine and Steve Martin.  The storyline has been addressed extensively by other reviewers, but I will add that this film definitely breaks Mom's old rule: ""don't make fun of the handicapped.""  Not only are Martin and Caine's characters both morally handicapped in the extreme, but Martin gets to play not one but two handicapped characters as he works his cons: one is in a wheelchair, and the other (Ruprecht)....well, I don't know exactly what Ruprecht's handicap is, but  I can understand why he's kept locked up in his room.  Finally, this movie has a lovely look to it, allowing you to take a fantasy trip to the French Riviera, stay in the finest hotels and villas, and sip the best champagne - that's a step up from most movies these days right there.  No explosions or violence.  Amazing."
113,dvd,"For me, this film works because of Michael Caine.  It is his style and strong characterization as Lawrence Jamieson that holds the film together and allows Steve Martin to riff with his role as the crass Freddie Benson.  The film takes some chances and not everything works and some of it seems as if it belongs in another film, but part of the key to this film is to distract you so you don't really suspect what is happening until the end.Glenne Headly is very nice as Janet Colgate, the object of a bet between the over confident con men.  Lawrence and Freddie are so sure of themselves that the loser is willing to leave town because each believes the other one is the loser.  However, Caine's character, Jamieson, begins to have pangs about treating such an innocent so callously.  Freddie, Steve Martin's more crass con man, has his own misgivings, as well.  There are several really well done supporting roles, but the movie is really about these three and how Caine and Martin begin working together and end up competing.  One of the finest bits in the movie is when Caine is trying to teach Martin the social graces of a gentleman con man.  Frank Oz did a good job with this movie.  Some might say that he let too much of Martin's shtick into the movie, but I think it serves its important purpose of misdirection.  And much as Jim Carrey today, Martin was quite hot then and audiences had certain expectations for him.  And the bits are funny in a way that also induces a bit of queasiness, but funny nonetheless.Watching the movie nowadays, while I still enjoy Martin's performance, I really enjoy Caine's more and notice Headly a bit more than I did the first time through"
114,dvd,"This is outright hilarious.  I admit I haven't seen the original version, but this one is fantastic.  It's choc full of witty and intelligent humour and it's well acted too.  Back in the day when I first saw this, I didn't see the ending coming.  Who would have guessed.  Without giving anything away, in a nutshell Steve Martin and Michael Caine compete to see who can swindle a set amount of dollars off a particular lady first.  It's a riot watching these two act out bizzare plots just to win the cash.  You must see this - you will be in stitches"
115,dvd,"Laurence Jameson (Caine) is a con-man, hustling rich corupt women out of thousands by lies and decept.  Freddy Benson is also a con-man, hustling your average everyday woman out of a meal or two here and there...but when the two of them end up in the same place at the same time they realize they have competition, and when Freddy realizes how much Laurence really makes off these women, well, he wants just as much.  The two decide to work together resulting in one of the funniest chain of events in movie history...whether Martin is playing Ruprecht (the monkey boy) or Officer Benson, the man crippled by memories of his fiance dancing naked with the host of Dance America, Martin is absolutly histarical.  Caine has a dry humor that works well when bouced off of Martins charisma.  I'm not a Caine fan but here he works well and casting can be forgiven since the script is tight and yes, Martin is brilliant.  Highly recomended...this will make you laugh out loud and Ruprecht will make you laugh so hard you will cry"
116,dvd,"Laurence Jamieson (Michael Caine) is a sophisticated confidence man that has be praying on the Riviera so long that he is even in the good graces of the local law enforcement. He crosses paths with an other ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrel"" Fred Benson (Steve Martin) who is more on the nickel and dime level.  After a fails attempt to shake Fred off Laurence decides to shape him up. Thy have to compete against the unknown predator only known as the jackal.Can Fred learn the finer points of relieving people of their monetary endowment?Or will everyone fall prey to the jackal?They could not have picked better people for the parts as the actors seem to have put a lot of their own personalities into the roles."
117,dvd,Great movie. It is a  must to have in your dvd collection. Some scenes in the movie are hillarious. you laugh until you have tears in your eyes. an interesting comparison of the American and European culture. the twist at the end incredible. Do not miss this movie.
118,dvd,"This movie is a must have for all family libraries. It appeals to adults and youth alike. A true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside, no matter what our outward differences are. Really teaches the lesson, ""Don't judge a book by its cover""."
119,dvd,"I dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980's or have gone to school in the United States but I can still relate to this movie. This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied.Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities.It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB. A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic.7.5/1"
120,dvd,"This movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different.  This is a comming of age film for the 1980's.  The acting is wonderful.  It is a different style of movie.  There were some really great movies comming out then.  Ferris Beulers Day off, Pretty in Pink and some kind of wonderful.  This is another one.  It is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time.  The 1980's is a time I was fond of.  I do not find it tacky as the media is right now.  This movie is funny.  Some of these classics get refered to in  other movies.  You might want to watch it"
121,dvd,"The Breakfast Club, one of the best movies out there. Timless no matter what's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie! :-"
122,dvd,"Smooth and easy transaction - my daughters thank you, too"
123,dvd,"John Hughes strikes gold with this hit classic.This film is about five kids who show at their high school for Saturday detention.While there,they open up to each other and express their feelings,putting up with each other and evading their wily principal(Paul Gleason).High-strung humor and laughs blend with superb storytelling as The Breakfast Club(Starring Judd Nelson as Bender,Molly Ringwald as Claire,Ally Sheedy as Allison,Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,and Emilio Estevenz as Andrew)are hillarious!A pleasant all-around film"
124,dvd,"I love John Hughes and I love the brat pack, and I have to say this movie is WAY better than all of the others.  And it's not just those who graduated in the 80s who haven't seen this movie who're locked in a cave, but ANYONE who has not seen Club is culturally deprived and should seek help imediately"
125,dvd,could you say me if there is french subtitles in this DVD!?thank you!Lil
126,dvd,"Since ""ER"" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience.Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama.Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor.Such show quality makes ""ER - The Complete First Two Seasons"" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future"
127,dvd,"The Crow (Collector's Series Boxed Set) consists of the first three of four in the series. Although all three have the same theme, each is quite different and exciting"
128,dvd,"The trio of The Crow films (yes, I enjoyed The Crow City Of Angels much as I enjoyed the first and the third) are unique by their own right, using brilliant cinematography to edge out the difference between them: The first, black and white homage to the graphic novels, with little pints of color; The second, sickly-greenish colors but somewhat interesting, as it shows us an ill-ridden type of a city much needing an angel guarding it; and the lively-yet-dark third movie, to show us real life tale of cruel justice gone bad.In each tale, The Crow is adapted quickly to his poor circumstances and finds his strength in the one true link to his former love (In the second, its the one true pure soul left in the city, Sarah), and badder-than-ever villains. Brandon Lee's performance will become (if not already) legendary, and I refer to his DVD interview to emphasis its greatness (""because we do not know when we will die, we think of life as an inexhaustable well"" will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it).These three are classics, not to be confused with the fourth, which has less impact, since it tries too hard to be original, yet looses something along the way in terms of casting, acting, and cinematography, as the desert-themed atmosphere hasn't worked that well. Should have used more of that ""grittier"" feel to the scenes (like the four horsemen's introduction scenes), if you ask me. Having read Poppy Z. Brite's ""The Crow: The Lazarus Heart"", I found it more suitable for an on-screen adaptation, and thinking of it as taking The Crow in more nastier ways than ever before. But by using the first three films success in doing a B-rated sequels, it will take a miracle for these movies from becoming a laughing-stock"
129,dvd,this is great..i love the crow movies especially the first one...it rocks this box set rocks ..and the ppl who created it rock too
130,dvd,"The first with Brandon Lee is a blast, as always.  I am not sure why everyone is so upset over the second one.  After all Eric and Shelly are refured to...by SARAH.  The second movie contiues with Sarah's story.  I dont know why, but most people miss that.  The third?  Well, I just got my set...and have not gotten to it yet.  But I expect it to be just as good"
131,dvd,"The first film is fantastic,and so are the others.I feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or trauma's.I mean that literly that when a person young or mid age watches these movies,I personly feel that they can strongly relate to such things within these movies.Weather their good or bad.Because honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it,for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about it.Even if it's just a movie.And, last,but not least the remarkable thing i like about this seriesso much is when a important person dies,that they can be givena 2nd chance at life by resurrection of the crow to do a rightfuldeed of justice in return to go to heaven for destroying evil that was done to a innocent person or themselves.I BELIEVE IT'S A ACT OF FAITH.."
132,dvd,"The second and third films are basically garbage.If THE CROW, directed by Proyas is the standard, then the rest are so far separated, that they fall into Oblivion.The tale as played by Brandon Lee works on just so many levels, and is in my view , one of the best films about Justice for victims. I have a number of versions of the CROW on VHS and DVD, and the Extras on the triple pack fail in one respect; there is an interview with Lee on the VHS version that is without a doubt, one of the most poignant, touching, and eerily prescient interviews on tape. Lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless, and yet... how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious... it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment, but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now , because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment, we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant. And just the loss ,the loss , or at least the change, of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the DVD.However, the triple  pack is well worth it, if only to get the brilliant film, and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original THE CROW, and the sequels should never have been made... Lee's legacy should have been left as it was.Lee is truly masterful in this film. Milking the franchise destroys Brandons Legacy"
133,dvd,"I splurged and treated myself to this set on my last birthday (Devil's Night.) I wanted to have all three films available should I feel the need to watch them again. The concept of supernatural justice has always appealed to me- it seems to be the only kind that really exists....I wasn't dissappointed in this set. It contains all three of the ""collectors series"" versions, which means that they are packed full of special features. The profile of James O' Barr the creator of the original comic series was especially good. Plus, there is a special little booklet that gives an outline of the making of the films.I really can't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films. I mean, the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different Crows and different injustices to be righted. Sure, the original film is by far the best, almost supernaturally superior, but the other two also manged to stay true to the vision. "
134,dvd,"The Crow- the first and obviously the best edition of The Crow series.Like many people say there was no other person destinied to play the role of Eric Draven better than Brandon Lee.Great action,excitement,and sadness any dark movie could ask for.With alot of great flash back scences to show the many faces of Draven.I give it 5/5 stars.The Crow:City of angels- It always makes me mad about hearing everyone dislike this movie because it didnt live up to the hype of the original crow.Its got a whole different plot to it.Im glad they didnt have each movie based around the same plot,that would pretty much make anyothers after the original seem rather one dimensional.I thought it had a lot of good things in it,show that there's different types of love and not just for the whole bf/gf. I give it 4/5 stars.The Crow:Salvation- in my opinion a really good movie in its own right.I mean it had alot of different things that the others were lacking,like mystery,we didnt know til near the very end of the movie,exactly who was behide the murders.With great acting by Jodi Lyne O'Keefe among others like Kirsten Dunst and Eric Mabius.The poor man being framed for the murder of his own girlfriend,his own death wasnt in vain because he came back from the dead to find the real criminals.I give it 4.5/5 stars.Like I said each movie had things about them that made them different and very well producted in their own rights.I'd say to any movie buff,these 3 you'd get your money's worth. 4.8/5 stars for the box se"
135,dvd,"We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry."
136,dvd,"I found this film very entertaining! I loved the subtle pokes at suburbia and all the headaches that comes with it. Adults will enjoy the story as well as younsters. It's always fun to hear some of your favorite actors' voices in animated character form. But besides the fun, I feel this film had some good underlying lessons too. When we 'overindulge', we often cause ourselves trouble. One overindulgent racoon gets himself, and his friends, into a pickle by being greedy and self-serving. Will they be able to fix his mess, and more important, will they forgive him?Chrissy K. McVay - Autho"
137,dvd,"The story drags a bit in the beginning, but by the end, my wife and I ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit.  The voice acting was great all around (especially Shatner as a possum prone to playing possum) and the CGI animation is fine.  Much of the movie seemed very familar - especially the set piece at the end which was lifted directly from the $300 episode of Futurama - but like they say, if you're going to steal, steal from the best.  Ben Folds music is another highpoint (stick around for his kid friendly rendition of Rockin' the Suburbs).The extras are pretty good with highlights being extensive footage of the actors performing their lines, an additional cartoon featuring the original cast, and a sneak preview of Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie.  All in all, I recommend this to fans of animation"
138,dvd,"Considering I just saw Cars, I wasn't so sure about Over the Hedge.  I mean, Cars actually became one of my favorites after I finished it!  But I gave this a shot and I'm glad I did.  I'll admit, the whole concept of R.J. using the others to repay a debt wasn't very original, but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable.  Now I'm debating whether or not I want to buy it.  I'd say rent it first, but if you have kids, this is a good one for your collection"
139,dvd,This is done by my friend. Over the Hedge is a very cute movie and one that the hole family can watch. It will have you laughing the hole time. It is hilarious and the animation is excellant and you'll be wanting to watch it again. I would deffanitly buy it! It was awesome
140,dvd,"Yeah yeah yeah, it was intended to kids...but the movie is so well made that grown-ups like yours truly will thoroughly enjoy it. The movie has thought provoking satire of modern lifestyle (SUVs, pizza delivery, urban sprawl, strip malls, and the like)that grown ups can immediately relate to. A bonus feature on the DVD shows what technology and blend of art, physics, computing and psychology a film of this caliber takes. If you are outside the intended age group for this movie (read: kids) and have no kids, I just gave you a perfect excuse to justify this DVD! Overall, highly recommended.  "
141,dvd,"For what you get in this DVD, the Amazon price ( current at the time of my writing) is fabulous value. The story runs the full range of emotions, and will touch the heart of kids, and Adults with good hearts, with the fun, joy and total adventure ride that the film encompasses. I am sure that everyone will support different  characters, and Hammy with his Caffeine power is just a wow of a performance.They certainly did right by the consumer on this product"
142,dvd,"I have loved the comic series and I definitely loved the movie, RJ, Vern and Hammy especially will forever be my favorite urban forest critters. The forest critters meets suburbia is so smart, and as funy as the comic it was based on.  "
143,dvd,"This is the best of the animated films that flooded the box office this summer.  Great voice talent, great storyline, and a highly enjoyable time at the movies.  The story pokes fun at our society and our excesses when a family of animals invade suburbia.  Dreamworks is giving Pixar a run for their money.  "
144,dvd,"it was a great exercise video, but my daughter and i had a little bit of a hard time keeping up with some of the moves, but overall it was a great workou"
145,dvd,"After about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the ""warm up"".  Otherwise, they will be very frustrated. It is very fast, very complicated.  Well Choregraphed but even the ""break it down"" segment moves at double speed.  "
146,dvd,Great video - easy to follow.  Dances are clean and fun to do
147,dvd,"My 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with.  I think it is best for those with a dance background.  The music is good, though"
148,dvd,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchase this DVD.  It is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all.  You are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly.  Even the ""break down"" section of the DVD is impossible to follow.  VERY Disappointing"
149,dvd,"This is the first of two Hardy Boys serials that originally appeared in ""The Mickey Mouse Club"".  You will not get ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" on this DVD, just The Hardy Boys segments.  In the mid 1990's the Disney Channel (cable tv) removed some of the MMC serials from the shows and created new half-hour shows of just those stories.  New opening  closing titles were created for these new mini-series.The then-famous song ""Gold Doubloons  Pieces of Eight"" introduces you to ""The Mystery Of Applegate's Treasure"".  A serialized story loosely based on the first Hardy Boys book ""The Tower Treasure"".Starring:Tim Considine (of Spin  Marty fame) as Frank Hardy.Tommy Kirk (Old Yeller  The Shaggy Dog) as Joe Hardy.Purists will be disappointed that they are not getting the complete, unedited, hour-long ""Mickey Mouse Club"" shows that these ran in, but fans will still enjoy these re-edited episodes"
150,dvd,"I saw this cinematic masterpiece with my French class, and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of French teenaged despair. We felt close to Vic, as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on Mattieu. Vic's parents seemed similar to my French class' parents, and so did Vic's school, with its social hierarchy and innocent parties. I feel that ""La Boum"" truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between American teenagers and their French peers. This effort is successful in my opinion, as our class found that we were laughing with Vic, crying with her, and screaming with her at her frustrating parents. We lived through ""La Boum"" in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl, and found that we weren't that much different, after all. ""La Boum"" made an impact on us more than ""Goodburger"" or ""Totoro"" ever could."
151,dvd,"For those who grew up watching the ""American Pie"" movies, the ""La Boum"" films must seem silly, harmless and bland.  If you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes, don't bother with this movie.  If you want some harmless family fun and some conversational French practice - rent or buy ""La Boum"""
152,dvd," I watched both parts of ""La Boum"" for the first time when I was about 12 years old. You can imagine how surprised I was when I found this movie on this website. This movie will definitely be appreciated by those who like French language, French cinematography and Sophie Morceau. It's a great listening practice. I don't want to go into details: if you want to know what it's about - watch it. It was made in 80s, and it makes it even more interesting"
153,dvd,"It is nice to see Sarah Michelle Geller in a not-so-nice, anti-heroine role here. I'm so used to seeing her as ""Buffy"""
154,dvd,"Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls. Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it"
155,dvd,"This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme.  The story involves alot of seduction and betrayal.  I call that the perfect mix for a teen movie.  I am a teenager myself, and I found it to be quite interesting.  The cast was great, and I think that made the movie even better.  It was a movie involvong every type of character, the good girl, the evil whore, and to top it off, one guy for both girls.  I would reccomend seeing it, but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes.  I hope you see it and enjoy"
156,dvd,"This modern day addaptation of Dangerous Liasons took us to another level with the heartless, calculated antics of teenagers.  While this was panned by critics, it spoke to something in the audience in it's sociopathic tendencies.Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, the student body president of an elitist New York boarding school and step sister of Ryan Phillipe, the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser.  She makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed Reese Witherspoon, who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage.  Should he succeed, he can have Kathryn.  If he fails, Kathryn can have his car.Perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel, but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves.  Just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what I mean.  Ryan Phillipe is every girl's dream come true and worst nightmare.  While he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can, he will post nude photos of them on the Internet and pat himself on the back as a stud.  Give him a challenge, such as Reese Witherspoon, and he has to work hard for it.  While he is truly a cad, he does in the end feel love for Reese because he had to work for her affections.  Kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no, as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions.  Listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom, that's what it's all about.  As the viewer, you can't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes.  How about that scene when Kathryn says she puts her trust in Jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon?  That's classic.  If anything it teaches you to not fall for others' fronts.  So girls, be careful of who seems so sincere.  And boys, don't be so cruel"
157,dvd,What more can you want?You have 5 of the hottest Hollywood stars and you get a sexy and also funny film.Get yor hands on this movie and the cruel Sarah Michelle Geller is facinating to watch.Also the end is such a tearjerker
158,dvd,"In the late 1990's something happened. Two movies came out. Neither was particularly well reviewed (although a few respected critics did give them good reviews) but despite all the negativity the two films became cult hits and  are still referenced to today in movies all the time. These two movies were""Wild Things"" and ""Cruel Intentions"". While ""Wild Things"" featured an elaborate plot, all-star cast, great sex scenes; ""Cruel Intentions"" plot is simple, has a cast of then up-and-comers, and has no nudity at all.Both of these movies scored with the MTV crowd and while you can find both films in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart, everyone remembers them. Also, both of these movies are just mindless fun; You're attention span doesn't have to be large and the people involved in both movies weren't trying to make classic films that would win Oscars and great acclaim, which in the long run attracted many critics and audiences to these movies. While I think Wild Things is a better movie, this film did keep me entertained for 94 minutes. Anyway, Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian Valmont. Sebastian is a spoiled rich kid, who happens to be incredibly charming and takes pleasure in having sex with young women and destroying their lives. Everyone knows what Sebastian is like, and he loves it. His step-sister Kathryn is pretty much the same, except she basks in the role of the ""good-girl"", she's even student body president of the school they attend. One day, Kathryn tells Sebastian how a guy named Court has dumped her and fallen for a young idiot girl named Cecile (Selma Blair) and she wants Sebastian's help to destroy the young girl's life. Sebastian has found something a bit more interesting...The new headmaster's daughter Annette (Reese Witherspoon). Annette is a virgin, who plans to stay that way and Sebastian sees a challenge. So, Kathryn proposes a wager. If Sebastian succeeds in deflowering Annette, he will get the thing he's been longing for, for years. He'll get to bed Kathryn. If he loses, Kathryn gets his most prized possession...His car. Pit of a perverted plot yes and it comes together in funny, sometimes even stupid ways. But, as I said earlier for mindless entertainment it's dead on. As for the performances, Gellar is great as the sadistic little nice girl. With Phillippe, however, I couldn't tell if his acting was bad or if that's how Sebastian would act. Blair captures the innocent, unwitting virgin girl quality perfectly.  She's so good in fact, she almost seems to be a virgin. Witherspoon (obviously, since she's the only person in this film to go and win anything) in really the strongpoint of the film. At this point in her career she really had the cute innocent girl face and qualities, and there's a few scenes in the movie where the ""face"" thing I mentioned is clearly there; but she's playing a different virgin girl from Blair. Witherspoon is playing the knowing, smart, want to wait for love girl. So, this movie is really not for everybody as you may have figured out by now. But if you're at the video store and just need 90 minutes of entertainment and fun, go for it. GRADE: B"
159,dvd,"I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart. But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin"
160,dvd,"I'm glad this is finally available on DVD - I've just about worn out my old VHS version of it.  On this DVD you get an introduction by Kathy, followed by a warm-up routine.  This is composed of some light aerobics and stretching.  Then you get five different ab workouts, one for each day of the week.  They each last about 10 - 12 minutes (I never actually timed them, but it seems like they get progressively longer from the first to the last).  Each workout consists of approximately five different exercises, though there may be two or three variations on an exercise, so there's quite a bit of variety.  Areas targeted are upper and lower abs and obliques (the muscles along the sides of the abs).  The Monday workout is fairly easy and shouldn't present a problem for any but the most out-of-shape individuals.  Tuesday's workout is only slightly harder.  By the time you get to Wednesday and Thursday, they start getting rather challenging.  To get through these you'll need to be in fairly descent shape.  Friday is the really difficult one, I'd say a person would have to be in excellent shape to complete it.Of course, you can just stop and take a short rest if the exercises get to hard for you, then join back in.  It took me about six weeks before I was able to complete the Friday workout all the way through without taking a few little breaks.  I like to use this video as a warm-up before my weight lifting workout.  Kathy does the workout along with 5 other people.  The music is unobtrusive synth-pop type stuff with a little funk edge to it.  You'll need a bench (or chair) and some dumbells (only used on two exercises, you could use some other object if you don't have dumbells).I'd recommend this tape for the moderately fit individual looking to get into even better shape.  You'll definitely get a six-pack from doing these workouts, provided that your body fat percentage is low enough that you can see your abs"
161,dvd,"This movie is hilarious, and it also delivers powerful truths about the workplace.  My favorite scene is Doralee's--Dolly Parton's character's--fantasy about killing the rotten boss.  This is Dolly's first movie, and she is a natural.  Everyone in this film does a superb job.  Made in 1980, but timeless"
162,dvd,"Jane Fonda is best taken on screen in small doses, and the presence of the ace funny girl Lily Tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside, good-girl inside Dolly Parton in supporting roles help this project immensely. My favorite actor in this one, however, is Dabney Coleman as the evil boss. There are a few excesses, including a marijuana scene which rings false for this trio of co-workers, but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours."
163,dvd,"Lilly Tomlin is hysterical in this movie. She makes this movie. It' fun, and your rooting for the women all the way. One specific part is not for the kids. My kids were bored with it. But I enjoyed it from the release date and it's still entertaining"
164,dvd,"I love 9 to 5.  It is truly a classic.  The pairing of Jane Fonda, Lilly Tomlin, and Dolly Parton is genius.  This movie keeps me laughing the whole time"
165,dvd,"Brilliant.Although the film has aged,it's still just as funny all these years later.This is a must for anyone who has ever had thoughts of getting revenge on a boss.The documentary afterwards is great as it offers a lookat how the three girls ended up filming it together.10/10 even after 25 years"
166,dvd,"  A great movie!  Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda are wonderful!  I'm so glad this movie is in my DVD library!  The laughter will be side splitting!  They really give Dabney Coleman a run for his money!  A must have DVD for any collection"
167,dvd,"FIRST THOUGHTS - -   This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. ""9 to 5"" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart ""fantasy-revenge"" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience. We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for ""Harold and Maude"", ""Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for ""Foul Play"" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited ""Ground Hogs Day"", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping ""9 to 5"" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for ""Best Editing"" for; ""Tora! Tora!Tora!"", 1970, ""Bound For Glory"",1976, ""Out Of Africa"", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and ""9 to 5"" is one of them. The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three ""innocent women"" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an ""Oscar"", ""Best Song"", and 3 ""Golden Globes"", includeing ""Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy"". This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is ""his"" 3 ""GIRLS"" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in ""All In The Family"" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and ""9 to 5"" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you. My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as ""Snow White"" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more. The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved. This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. ""REEL JUSTICE"", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated. --* THE CAST --* Colin Higgins  - Director / Screenwriter Jane Fonda  - Judy Bernly Lily Tomlin  - Violet Newstead Dolly Parton  - Doralee Rhodes Dabney Coleman  - Franklin Hart Jr. Sterling Hayden  - Tinsworthy Elizabeth Wilson  - Roz Henry Jones  - Hinkle Lawrence Pressman  - Dick Marian Mercer  - Missy Hart  --* THE AWARDS --*Best Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Academy   Best Actress- Musical or Comedy (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe   Best Original Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe   New Star of the Year - Female (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe  DVD FEATURES: It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release. The Disney characters in Violet's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release. It has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same DVD in either English or French with English or Spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all [of course]. Naturally, some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases. FINAL THOUGHTS - - This wonderful film is highly recommended and ""9 to 5s"" entertainment value stands up very well to repeated viewings and the passage of 26 years."
168,dvd,"This review is for the 2001 DVD release.  Have you ever daydreamed about what you would like to do to your boss who was too hard on you or did something to you objectionable?  Well, these secretaries did.  They carried out a plan against their boss and got away with it.  Please keep in mind, this film is a comedy and was made to laugh at.  However, their are some strong messages here that can be well learned.  Bosses should not verbally abuse and/or sexually intent, touch, harass any employee.  This film does point out employees have rights too.  Managers can be in the wrong too. Jane Fonda is ""Judy Bernly"".  Recently divorced.  Has no experience, but is a very decent woman.  Today is her first day at Consolidated Companies LTD.  On her first day everything goes wrong.  Lily Tomlin is ""Violet Newstead"".  She has worked their forever.  Never spies.  She is ready for a promotion. She trains Judy on her first day.  In fact, Violet has trained most of the people there and they have been promoted instead of her.  Dolly Parton (in her first film) is ""Doralee Rhodes"".  Mr. Hart's main secretary.  There is bad gossip going around about the boss and the secretary, but it is not true.  Doralee is a married woman  and is a Christian and pure as Judy is and would never engage in bad behavior at work.  Dabney Coleman is the boss, ""Franklin Hart"". He is the boss and the vice-president.  Has has a bad mouth towards secretaries and wants ""personal servitude"" that is not part of the job description.  After the boss makes personal advances towards Doralee, makes inappropriate comments towards Violet and dismisses Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) for having light conversation in the bathroom and guessing the bosses salary, and after another incident, Violet, along with Doralee and Judy later decide that something has to be done to the boss and improvements must be made within the company.  Better working conditions for all.  Violet just might get her promotion yet.Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson, Peggy Pope, Sterling Hayden, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer.  Yes, that is Dolly Parton singing ""Nine To Five"". Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman also worked together in On Golden Pond (1981).  Followed by the tv series Nine To Five (1982-83) with Rita Moreno as ""Violet"", Valerie Curtin as ""Judy"", and Rachel Dennison as ""Doralee"".  Jane Fonda was one of the Producers and Executive Producers.  Rachel Dennison is Dolly Parton's real-life sister.  Update: As of April 2006, the cast reunited to celebrate the 2006 DVD release.  According to Jane Fonda on ""Larry King Live"", they are in ""talks"" of a sequel"
169,dvd,"However, did anyone else notice how 25 years later, Dabney Coleman is referring to Tomlin, Fonda and Parton as ""gals"" and ""girls"" in the 9 to 5 at 25 featurette? Made me wonder...."
170,dvd,"This movie may be unfamiliar to American viewers, who watch american movies only. But this is a very humorous movie, starring some of Russia's best comedians - Yuri Nikulin and Andrei Mironov.In Bulgaria, they used to show it on every New Year's day.The plot is like this: A russian turist (Nikulin) in Istanbul slips and falls and says ""Chort Poberi"" (which means something like ""damn"", or ""hell"", or ""go to the devil"" in russian language.)This happens to be a password for some bandits, who await their man (Mironov) to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his would-be broken arm. Without realizing what is happening, Nikulin's character smuggles the diamonds. Then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits. And there is a happy end...Watch this film, I'm sure you will enjoy it. In Bulgaria, you can legally buy it on a DVD for just $2"
171,dvd,"An hilarious movie about mistaken identity, the Russian mafia, the KGB and an unsuspecting nice guy in the middle of it all!Nikulin is hilarious as usual, and what can you say about the peerless Mironov?I watched this movie back in St.P some 14 years ago, and even when my Russian was just in the basic stage I could still follow it. Once my Russian progressed, I grasped all the very funny word play and situational humour.If you like enjoying yourself - buy this movie"
172,dvd,"I have read one negative review about this film and I would like to clarify the statements made in it. I am Russian so, obviously, I like this film. It has typical Russian humor, it is a farce, so do not look for higher meanings in the jokes, it makes fun of the social standards of the Soviet regime as well as the people who served it so well. It features some of the best Russian actors that we love seeing and acting; they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well. If you are a tough judge of movies, then please make sure you know Soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in American movies before you call it crap. I do not see why there should be a problem with characters not talking for the first ten minutes of the movie. In fact, it is just a few minutes during which you are shown the premise of the movie. And as for cyrillic letters not making sense: this is a Russian movie and you are bound to see everything written in our gibberish alphabet. Besides, the movie begins with a cruise in a foreign country (it was shot in Baku, Azerbajan but is supposed to be Turkey). The language spoken by the locals as well as the signs on buildings are gibberish - it was made up specially for the movie.That said, I want to say a few words about the plot. Semen Semenovich is a diligent Russian economist goes on a cruise, where he gets acquainted with a mafia mob's right hand, Kozodoev, whose assignment is to pick up diamonds from the supplier and deliver it back to Moscow via a cast on his arm. During one of the last stops, Semen Semenovich gets mistaken for Kozodoev and ends up with a cast and jewels inside it. As he returns to Moscow, Semen contacts the police. Now, he has to pose as bait and escape the traps elaborately planted by the mafia.As I already said, the movie is fantastic. Just remember that it is a farce. And no, there is not slapstick humour. Be open-minded and enjoy! Oh, and by the way, all the jewelry you will see on the screen is authentic. It's mentioned in the beginning that the film crew would like to thank all Soviet individuals who lend their gems for the filming."
173,dvd,"This movie is the greatest classic comedy ever. Don't listen to the lady, who gave this movie only 2 stars, she doesn't know what she is talking about. Only person with the limited sence of humor may not like this film. Believe me it's wonderfull.!!!!"
174,dvd,This movie is one of those films that never grow old. It's been the total hit for more than 30 years. Sparkling humour won't let you be bored. The acting is great! Phrases from the movie are now popular aphorisms! The movie arises in you the warmest feelings! Enjoy this movie
175,dvd,"This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this movie. Buy it, and enjoy"
176,dvd,"This film was dope, a must see for anyone who is curious about Hip-Hop culture, or for those that need to know the History. A very informative documentary, an essential in any hip-hop collection"
177,dvd,"WOW! This brought back so many memories for me. I was shocked when a friend of mine gave me this DVD as a Christmas present because I'm the ultimate Old-School head. And to my surprise (and his) I'm in it! As the DVD plays, there are seemingly a hundred still shots of ""jams"" and ""crew pictures"" being faded in and out that give you a glimpse of our attitudes and fashions of the time. If you were there, you may spot some of your peeps. This is one of the most accurate DVDs chronicling the birth of Hip-hop, when it wasn't about the money  bling. The ""artists"" interviewed are telling the real story. A must have for all the aspiring DJ's, MC's, and dancers of today"
178,dvd,"It amazes me how something like B-boyin' that is so inventive, exhilerating, and positive could have only been in the mainstream media for less than 2 years (circa 1983-1985) but a fad like being a gangster (that is so negative), has been in the mainstream media for nearly 15 years! (NWA introduced it in the late 80's. It's sad to see that Hip Hop has turned into the very thing that it swore to diminish."
179,dvd,"Covering all aspects of b-boy culture, this great documentary is a must have for all those who always loved b-boying.You may drop a tear or two at the end of it.Just for serious hip-hop cats.Just explendid"
180,dvd,"This has to be the freshest b-boy documentary I've ever seen!!!! From the early days in N.Y. with Kool Herc and the Rock Steady Crew, you are treated to the best footage and interviews on this planet!!  Everything is covered here you won't be dissapointed.  Much love to all B-boys and B-girls in the universe. Much respect to Crazy Legs and company for a job well done.  If you love breaking you can't miss this one!!DJ GrassMiami, Fl"
181,dvd,"I am a 'professional' female in my 30's, and remember and love breakdancing. I am soooo glad I bought this DVD which I plan on giving to my son for his birthday. But now the DVD will be OURS! What's great about it is that it shows the old 70's/early 80's b-boying stars  clips and then talks to the same people all grown up in their 30's/40's today. You WILL watch this over and over! Great history and roots of this NYC, then West Coast phenomenon...If only today's Hip Hop  Rap were as fun and clean as breakdancing was.."
182,dvd,"This DVD totally covers pretty much everything you should know about the B-boy and B-boy culture.  As far as how it started, to where it stands today.  The interviews are raw, and to the point.  From the footage of the early days, to the present, is very well put together. It just, all flows.  Very fresh.  Also the special features isn't just a bunch of crap, which usually gets put on DVD's.  This DVD is way worth the price, and well wicked.  Buy It!  peace"
183,dvd,This video is definitely a worth wild DVD. From the original footage to today - it was all great. I watched it three times over the weekend and still saw new moves that Ive never saw before. its a great investment. Crazy Legs is the man
184,dvd,"Ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house. 8 women, every one of them with their affective lacks, their tribulations. Little miseries, sorrows and disillusions. Each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered Marcel.The admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage, with a sublime red carpet that remind us Bergman in Cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo) expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film, plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses.   A must-see!		"
185,dvd,"Seemingly a French take-off on the classic English Mystery Play format this delightful farce is actually a perfect proof of how great and sexy, women of all ages are (especially French women).Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Virginie Ledoyen, Ludivine Sagnier, Isabelle Huppert, Danielle Darrieux, Fanny Ardant, Firmine Richard, Emmanuelle Bï¿½art"
186,dvd,"A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all.I thought that the plot, the scenery, the songs and everything else was all great.  It is a French musical whodunnit but one that doesn't take itsself too seriously.  Whoever wrote the bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either (besides, it's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie, so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate.)My favorite characters were played by Denouve and Huppert (both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights) and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained, even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required.  Then again, it is a musical, so disbelief should be left at the door"
187,dvd,"Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid"
188,dvd,"The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by."
189,dvd,"This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. ""Eight Women"" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. ""Eight Women"" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience."
190,dvd,"Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle Bart was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais. Deneuve, Bart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in.What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes!The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good!Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add"
191,dvd,"This farcical ""who done it"" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time.  Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek ""who done its"" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death.Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country.  Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion.  While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about.The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties.  (Note Suzon's pink/orange pony skirt.)  To quote a line from the film, ""it's a sad family affair"" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight.  Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film.  Strange.In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs.Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered.  She looks stately, beautiful and more than a bit spoiled.  Danielle Darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother, Mamy.  Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid.  Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law.  The cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet fifties-ish way.  In a kind of gender joke, no men appear in the movie, although we do see the back of Marcel (Gaby's husband) a couple of times.You will not be able to guess who done it, but I will not tell you why.See this for Danielle Darrieux, one the grande dames of the French cinema whose film credits go back to 1931--yes, 1931.  She has a lot of fun in a juicy part"
192,dvd,"Yes, this murder mystery is twisted and dark, but also wonderful to watch.  All the characters (with the possible exception of the father) are so intriguing and bizarre...and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat.  What a nasty family, but one can't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates.  They put the fun in the word dysfunctional, without a doubt.  Beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery.  True that it is primarily shot indoors, but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright.  Maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot, I don't know, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes.  The story itself is pretty good, and not difficult to follow, but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss.     "
193,dvd,"8 women is a good musical/ murder mystery with humor, light heartedness and mystery. It combines a bunch of the best French actrices, and an enjoyable plot. A real guesser until the end"
194,dvd,"Wall Street, the movie starring Michael Douglas is lame compared with this docutainment.  Whereas the first offering is fictitious, the latter is Enron, a global brand that's since become a verb and even becoming skits in the Simpsons!  How would a company that started out humbly would grow so fast so big in a few years would then taking record breaking speed to go bankrupt and then ruining the livelihood of so many ordinary people and that it puts the Bush family in an awkward situation for being overfriendly with Ken Lay, the founder of Enron in the early days?  This docutainment could have been a dry  boring subject and yet, it's captivating to view.  The authors believed that what made Enron so enticing to the public mass is its human tragedy aspect.  Brilliant people who would be so blinded by their own arrogance, pride, narcissim, brilliance, greed that they would do something so stupid for digging a hole so big and so deep that they couldn't get themselves out of it.  This docutainment is the story about Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, the fall guy, Falstow (the CFO) who would be left to hang to dry and their doings that would have such a detrimental impact on so many people.  It's outrageous to hear the tape recording of Enron traders of bragging the money that they were making at expense of California power crisis.  Somehow, human tragedy of such epic proportion shall repeat itself again someday because we humans don't seem to learn from mistakes.  An intriguing documentary that needs to be seen to be believed"
195,dvd,"This is an excellent portrayal of the Enron fiasco. It utilizes footage and sound bites, and interviews, it's absolutely amazing what happened! This film is a must see for everyone"
196,dvd,"Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms.  More importantly, this documentary shows how the American criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations.  As a result of the aforementioned, I use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike."
197,dvd,"The documentary Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room had a bit of a rough start. Although intriguing, it failed to deliver the rough sketch of the Enron scandal quick enough. I'll shamefully admit that I had forgotten most of the details of the Enron scandal, as I was in college when it broke and I didn't care too much about it at the time. But, once the overall story had been discussed, this documentary did a fairly good job of telling a compelling narrative and trying to explain the rather complicated financial wizardry that was ultimately the corporation's downfall. The depictions of Skilling were very clear and it was nice to see a woman was at the heart of breaking the story and writing the movie (which was based on a book she co-wrote). Amusing use of music and title-cards kept the pace quick, and unlike Michael Moore's documentaries, this one was actually full of well presented facts. I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie, especially because it reveals yet another reason to hate W and his administration. I wish more people were interested in this kind of reporting and that our day-to-day media was this intellectually engaging"
198,dvd,The news did not really give justice to what was really happening with Enron during that time.  Why it fell.  How some people wondered why they did not have data like a normal company.  This movie is just wonderful.  It shows how they made a total joke of the American Stock Market and got away with it.  Power outages in California were actually intentional by Enron.  The story goes on obviously after the movie has been filmed.  With that misterious death of Ken Ley. Sucide also resulted as a consequence of this crash.  Many people have no savings yet has anyone gone to jail over this yet?  Watch how much fun they were having in the hay day of Enron.  How they played hard and how a few people got really rich while others were devistated.  This is an imporatant movie.  Then you might want to review the more recent news on the company to see where we are at now.  Where is Jeffrey Skilling now??  Last I knew he still was not in Jail.  Who will be punished for this or is it okay because of our new corporate climate?  Okay in the sense of the law of the USA that is.  Martha Stewart went to jail and served time will anyone for this???
199,dvd,"I am a CPA  I watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take, essentially because of the fall of Enron. I have since bought the video  watched it at least 5 other times. Of course there are political slants. For example, they try  tie the Bush administration(s)(Sr.  Jr.) to Enron. But, the majority of the film deals with what happened to Enron, so that in the end, the stock you purchased was worth $0. I would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary. A riveting documentary on the rise  fall of Enron  who the major players in Enron were."
200,dvd,"Kenneth Lay and his cohorts were looking to make millions not for the company but for themselves. They took advantage of the investors, the employees and the public. They knew what they were doing and were stopping at nothing to get what they wanted. The chips came crashing down when speculation from a Fortune magazine writer saw that the financial figures didn't add up. Skilling knew that the company was facing severe trouble if it were found that they were tampering with numbers and taking millions from the corporation. Enron fell hard like the World Trade Center when it was reported that its earnings were dropping like flies and bankruptcy was the ultimate demise.The documentary explores the dark side of humans. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were ruthless as well as greedy hoarding large sums of money for their personal use putting employees out of work and leaving them with no nest egg. They cashed out their stocks and rested on their earnings while their side employees have to suffer not only the financially but emotionally.This is a very good documentary to watch. No one should be scared not to invest in the stock market. But always be careful and alert as to how this company is operating"
201,dvd,"At first, I wasn't too keen on seeing this movie- Its title, ENRON-THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM- suggested to me that it would be about a bunch of smart guys number crunching on their way to faking accounting records.  What else would a bunch of 'smart guys' do?Well, certainly the Enron executives did this.  The film explains in easy to understand terms how Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling demanded the use of 'Mark to Marketing' - an accounting scheme allowing him to post 'future profits' of an new idea immediately (ie, if an idea of inventing a new spaceship design is expected to reap a billion dollars in the future, one could post the profits now, never mind that the ship may never get built, if built may not work as envisioned, or people may loose interest in space, and so on.) Of course, such profits were not 'real' but nicely balanced off Enron's actual massive losses.  Also balancing off Enron's massive losses were the fake companies created by Andy Fastow, which he used to bury Enron's enormous debts- and in the meantime, pocketed millions for himself.But while shady accounting schemes may explain the technical, proximate causes of the fall of Enron, it is not the ultimate explanation.  The ultimate reason why Enron fell is pure, naked, ugly- and all to human- Greed.   And this is what the film portrays, and does so brilliantly, with insider footage showing 'Enron skits' and meetings, and recordings of conversations and deals being made in the trading floor.We get to see Jeff Skilling in a skit in which he snickers and mocks his own accounting strategy, stating ""...we can add a kazillion dollars to the bottom line.""  We see Andy Fastow in an insider video, with a sly grin on his face, explaining to greedy bankers (all the big guns like Citibank, Deutsche Bank, etc) his scheme to be the CFO of both his shell company LJM and Enron.  Never mind any conflict of interest, as he will always be on 'LJM's side of the transaction"" (netting both him and the greedy bankers money at the expense of Enron). Even worse was the greedy, cut throat culture that developed among Enron traders.  My jaw dropped as I heard one trader coolly telling a California energy power station to 'power down' for a bit, by 'making up' an excuse, so they could artificially limit California's energy supply to make obscene profits.  Even worse were traders laughing hysterically and cheering as energy power lines burned in California, chanting ""Burn Baby Burn!!""  And why not?  Supposedly a young trader could make enough in one afternoon to buy a Mercedes Benz, flat out!Other facets of the ugly face of Enron included the bizarre 'extreme sport' trips taken by Enron Execs (bunch of guys riding motor cycles in the dirt) and the practice of taking clients out to strip clubs and charging it to the corporate account (exemplified by Lou Pai, but was popular among the rest as well- when this was eventually cancelled at the severe protest of some female employees, apparently a pall of silence fell over the trading floor for 3 days!).  There is also Enron's arrogance that it could 'trade' everything, including the weather!Jeff Skilling comes off as particularly arrogant- he states he wanted to help FORTUNE reporter Bethany Mclean ""understand what she is asking"" when she wanted to know why Enron's numbers didn't add up. When despite his bullying, she decided to publish her findings (or lack of) anyway, he amazingly calls her decision 'unethical.'  Well, clearly, Mclean did know what she was asking- ""IS ENRON OVERPRICED"" was the first article suggesting something maybe wrong with Enron.  Later, he calls someone else who questioned the validity of Enron's accounting an ""a-- h---.""Compared to Skilling and the others, Ken Lay comes off as rather clueless, but just as greedy. It is almost as if he didn't really care what went on in his company, as long as it made money.  We see him on 9-11-2001 comparing Enron's troubles to 9-11, but stating with confidence that things will bounce back.  Later, when Enron is in a free fall, he makes bizarre claims to his worried employees that the company is strong, and will regain healthy stock figures, causing one of his employees to ask him ""are you are on crack.""  Indeed.  The film also highlights the fact that guilt for the Enron debacle falls far beyond Enron itself.  Greedy corporate banks actively participated in illegal money-making deals with Fastow, as mentioned above.  Accounting firm Arthur Anderson happily cooked Enron's books with Mark-to-Marketing accounting and other accounding frauds, and then shredded millions of documents when investigations began.  Stock analysts happily took Jeff Skilling's word that Enron's stock was doing great- and issued 'strong buy' or 'buy' ratings, without actually analyzing the stock.  Lawyers signed off on everything.  And the rest of us, dazzled by the stock market boom and greedy at the thought of making big bucks, kept buying Enron stock.  No one ever ""asked why"" Enron was such a shining star- and whether it really deserved to be.    The insider material on Enron (the recordings, the videos) alone would have made a fascinating, shocking tale.  But the movie adds incisive, fast paced interviews with both insiders and critics of Enron, as well as catchy, and very appropriate theme tunes.  (`Dear Mr. Fantasy' for Andy Fastow is particularly appropriate- as it sounds like `Dear Mr. Fastow!')As Amazon suggests, watch this move with THE CORPORATION.  THE CORPORATION provides the theoretical background as to the psychopathic nature of all corporations, while this movie provides the perfect, feature length case-study.  "
202,dvd,"****1/2Don't be surprised if you find yourself throwing things at the screen while watching ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,"" a brilliantly effective and meticulously researched documentary (based on the book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind) that is guaranteed to get both your dander and your adrenaline up to dangerously high levels.Rarely does a real life event provide us with as clear and universally recognized a symbol of a larger social theme as does the fall of Enron, which, in the years since it happened, has come to stand for everything that's wrong with corporate America.  It is the classic tale of corruption and unethical behavior performed in the service of unbridled greed.  That the men responsible for the disaster took so many innocent people down with them is what makes it a tragedy.  In fact, more than one person interviewed for the film draws the parallel between the downfall of Enron and the sinking of the Titanic - an apt analogy if ever there was one, only, in this case, the captains had no intention of going down with the ship, preferring instead to ruthlessly knock over any number of helpless women and children in the desperate race to the lifeboats. The beauty of the film is that it takes a very complex and convoluted story and makes it completely comprehensible to those of us who might otherwise get lost in the maze of arcane corporate-world details.   The movie introduces us to the key players - primarily CEOs Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay, and CFO Andrew Fastow - showing the step-by-step process by which they built the energy corporation virtually from scratch, raised it to the position of seventh largest company in the world, then slowly destroyed it through deceit, hubris and greed - but not, of course, before bestowing obscene multi-million dollar packages on themselves as compensation.  We see how they employed little more than smoke-and-mirror accounting schemes to pull the wool over the eyes of investors, regulatory commissions and fellow employees.  However, the film makes it clear that a large number of ""reputable"" banks and loan agencies must also have been complicit in the company's malfeasance for all of this to have come off so effectively.   As always, it is the ""little guy"" who winds up getting shafted.  Probably the greatest hair-pulling section of the film involves Enron's cold-blooded creation and manipulation of California's bogus ""energy crisis"" in the early 2000's, which drained billions from the state`s treasury, a situation which the newly elected President Bush, ever sympathetic to his buddies in the energy business, refused to help rectify.  Just as bad is the CEOs' callous encouragement of their own lower level employees to invest their retirement savings in the company's 401K plan that the chief executives themselves knew would soon be defunct.  With hissable villains like these around, who needs fiction?The sole consolation is the fact that the system did work in the end, that the wrongdoers eventually overreached to such an extent that the house of cards they had built finally came tumbling down.  There's certainly a great deal of joy in seeing the creeps responsible for the catastrophe being carted off to jail in handcuffs and sweating under the public scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee.  (It should be noted that the film predates Ken Lay's death in 2006).  The movie also balances the case by highlighting some of the ""heroes"" in the story, primarily whistleblowers within the company and a resourceful reporter for FORTUNE magazine who was the first to hint in a public forum that Enron might just be the corporate equivalent of the emperor with no clothes.This is more than just a mere ""talking heads"" documentary.  It explores the details of the story within the broader context of unbridled capitalism, de-regulation, and corporate corruption.  The movie also shows us how strangely immature the men at the head of this company were, with their frat boy antics and the daredevil activities they indulged in to erase their ""nerd"" image and to establish their bona fides as real ""macho"" men.  The fact that individuals of this caliber could spell the ruin of so many trusting people is what gives the movie's title that little ironic kick.By all means, don't miss this film - though you might want to have a good stiff drink handy for when it's over"
203,dvd,This dvd I received was way better than chocolate. The dvd was quick in getting sent to me and I loved being able to track it and know exactly when it should be here by. The dvd was in wonderful condition. New in fact and wonderful
204,dvd,"Plot twists everywhere!  A movie of many mini-dramas in one, but blended together so well it's an exhilirating rollercoaster of love, lust, and the bonds of family.We don't know anything about Maggie (Karyn Dwyer) before she comes to this ""interesting part of town"" other than she's left university to find herself, and BE herself.  She gets a phone call from her mother, who doesn't know she's a lesbian, and the fun begins.  Mother Lila, (Wendy Crewson) is divorcing her husband and with brother Paul (Kevin Mundy) in tow, needs a place to stay.  Maggie finds a loft as a sublet, but there is a snag.  After performing a lip synching at a club she's met the girl of her dreams.  Kim (Christina Cox) is staying with Maggie as well, now to keep the affair from Lila!  Kim is torn.  She wants Maggie to come out to her mother so they don't have to hide their relationship.  She wants Maggie to be able to openly declare her love for her, but Maggie is so afraid.  The fear ultimatly threatens to tear the two women apart.We meet Maggie's friends, her boss Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald), her friend, a transexual named Judy (Jerry Outerbridge), her co-worker Carla (Marya Delver), and coffee shop owner Tony (Tony Nappo).  Frances is at war with Customs, as they continually threaten her livlihood by witholding shipments of books and videos for her store.  Carla is a bi-sexual free spirit who ""likes hard centers, soft centers, all the chocolates in the box"".  Judy, who is under the misundersanding that her father has forgiven her for becoming a transexual befriends Lila and starts bringing her around to Maggie's point of view.  Inadvertantly, Maggie's friends begin introducing Lila and Paul to new and exciting experiences.  Maggie's fears of coming out to her mother are soon alieviated when Lila discovers her in bed with Kim and the conflict grows.  Amid gay bashing and hate crimes the outcome of the movie is perfectly tied up and delightful.  Helped along with an astounding soundtrack this is one movie you simply MUST add to your collection"
205,dvd,Very simply... it was good.  I thought it to be funny and real.  I'd watch it again
206,dvd,"I really hope that no one was expecting an Oscar worthy performance. No it`s not the best movie ever as far as plot and acting but, I don`t remember seeing too many high dollar ads for it, do you? It was a DAMN good feel good movie though. This movie will help point out a few issues the GLBT community faces but barely scratches the surface. If it is erotic lesbians you seek, KEEP SEEKING. Even the uncut version is barely ""R"" worthy.So once again everyone, NOT a pent house flick, NOT a documentary AND in no way is it Oscar worthy, and with all that said, It was one of the best ROMANTIC COMEDIES I`ve seen in a long time. I highly recomend it to anyone just looking for a relaxing evening"
207,dvd,"It's hard to mix a meaningful, important message with fun and laughs. Better Than Chocolate is the best example of that successful combination. An important plot full of emotion and difficult situations mixes with humor and sexuality to create a full plate of entertainment with this film. Character development is superb, making the viewing experience that much more interesting. There's not a boring part. In fact, more than one story harmoniously combines with others to engage the mind and senses. The film is not a serious drama. But it's not only a comedy. The characters are real. The humor flows naturally. Even though I know how the story ends, I'll watch it over and over"
208,dvd,"My partner and I really enjoyed this movie there are alot of issues that we can relate to. Judy gives trans gender people a good name. All the caracters rolls are positive and I think that it shows its not all about sex, there is love involved. Definetly a must see!!!"
209,dvd,"when i first watched this movie yes i did realize it was poorly written and what ever but i love this movie because it helped me to get courage to finally tell my mom i was gay. i think this person who left the last comment was way too dramatic,they just dont know how to appreciate things, also he threw it way out of proportion by saying he should've got RENT. what a stupid idea, rent was even worse"
210,dvd,"This really didn't help me understand the mind of lesbians.  It was poorly written or acted or presented or something.  I was looking for insight to try and gain appreciation for the lifestyle so that I could better understand the culture, but was left with a silly sex movie.  Very disappointed.   I regret the purchase... should have gotten RENT instead"
211,dvd,"Thank God for this essentially preserved movie version of the stage hit by one of my all time favorite broadway actresses Gwen Verdon. She just lights up the screen. Bob Fosse's dances are spectacular and the music by Ross and Adler is just classic. They just don't make them like this anymore. Sheer heaven in hell-with the devil played by the incomparable Ray Walston. If you love musicals, you must add this to your collection!"
212,dvd,"Certain movies really capture the feel of their themes, and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of Baseball like no other. Of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned. But haven't we learned by now, that the Devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals? I hope so. What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem. Thanks largely to the astounding talent of Bob Fosse's choreography. Tab Hunter's shining moment. Gwen Verdon's 'Whatever Lola Wants' is the showstopper, but Ray Walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny Devil. A film favorite for most of my life"
213,dvd,"i remeber, seeing this movie baasically, when it was first released. and as I have a large collection of musicals, I wanted to add it to my collection, as i had not seen it available in Australia. After viewing Damn Yankees after 40 50 years, was very enjoyable, Gwen Verdon great, and Tab Hunter, yes"
214,dvd,"Once upon a time, Broadway musicals were quickly adapted into successful widescreen presentations, often, but not always, with the original Broadway stars.  This is an example of one of Hollywood's best.A previous reviewer called this stagebound.  I am not sure what was meant.  ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins"" are musicals shot entirely on soundstages, and look it; ""Damn Yankees!"" involved several outside locations, including the old Los Angeles Wrigley Field, which was home to the Los Angeles Angels in their first season in 1961.  It was a great backdrop for the ""Shoeless Joe"" number.The film is not in stereo (even though the CD soundtrack is); I don't know if the stereo soundtrack album would matchup with the film soundtrack, or whether there stereo tracks recorded.  In any event, Warner Bros. did not dig them out, and this DVD is bereft of any significant extras.Apart from that, this is a must buy for classic performances (Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon, particularly), wonderful songs ((You Gotta Have) Heart, Shoeless Joe, etc.), and some great smaller roles (the crusty Senators' manager, Jean Stapleton playing Edith Bunker 15 years before she played Edith Bunker, and Bob Fosse dancing with Gwen Verdon)"
215,dvd,Gwen Verdon at her finest.  Great performances by an amazing cast.  Great music and incredible choregraphy.  Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse - such a team
216,dvd,"The audio/video quality of the original movie is not quite up to modern picture and sound standards, and the original play and movie we indelibly tied to the 50's scene (""Cool, man""), but the transition to DVD has not hurt it a bit. The songs and dancing are very stylized, definitely reflecting Donen's handicraft. Seeing the actors when they were almost kids is very interesting. I definitely enjoyed it"
217,dvd,This classic show was skillfully brought to film and the casting is great. Gwen Verdon is fabulous as Lola and Ray Walston as the Devil is superb. Well worth having for collectors of American Musical Theater
218,dvd,Thankfully unlike other movies that I remembered seeing years ago this one lived up to expectations with Ray Walston as the Devil stealing the show
219,dvd,"Ray Walston is perfect as the endearingly likable devil, Gwen Virdon is teriffic as Lola the vamp and Tab Hunter is perfectly believable as Joe Hardy.  Great dancing, great songs ""Gotta have heart,"" ""Whatever Lola Wants"" and ""Two Lost Souls"" great love story and great actual shots of Mickey Mantle and Gil MacDougald in action makes for a winner"
220,dvd,"With an all-star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending,  Inside Man is an above-average heist thriller.  However, as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary, and Inside Man is no exception.  At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America.  From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold.  I liked that part of the movie, but I can understand how others are bored with Lee's tactics.  Overall, the plot, direction, and all-star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance"
221,dvd,"Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington.  This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting.  Exciting.  Smart casting and directing.  Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past.  This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride.  Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer.  Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal.This film had all aspects of our human nature.  What more can anyone ask for.  It makes you think...Would you risk your life to prove that someone else's life is worth more than yours if you get caught?"
222,dvd,NEED I SAY MORE---GOOD LIKE EVERYMOVIE HE ACTS IN--GOOD STORY LINE WITH A TWIST..
223,dvd,"One of Denzel's finest movies, but anything he's in has to be good or better"
224,dvd,"""Inside Man"" unfolds its characters and plot in seeming slow-motion -- perhaps a bit like a real-life hostage drama. The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time? The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific. A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge  is just one of many ornaments to this well-made film. The writing and the plot are believable -- and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies. The final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film.Other than the pace of the film -- which mimics the wait-and-see pace of real negotiations (but is slow to the point of torpor) -- ""Inside Man"" is brilliant"
225,dvd,"I've seen quite a few movies trying to win the title ""The prefect bank robbery"" for the crime they describe. This one wins the jackpot. The robbery's whole concept is ingenious. Just when I thought there couldn't be any real innovations in this field comes ""Inside Man"" to show me how wrong I was. From the beginning to the end, this film is nothing but professional and completely believable - I watched the screen and said to myself: ""for heaven's sake, people could actually pull it off!"". Add to that the top notch cast - Denzel Washington, Judie Foster and Clive Owen - and you get a film you wouldn't want to miss. "
226,dvd,"I have seen the original Dutch version by Director Sluizer, and this one holds up quite well on its own. Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) stops at a gas station with his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). In a matter of minutes, she disappears without a trace. And although Jeff searches everywhere for her, she vanishes without ever being heard from again. He lives every moment of his life trying to locate her. Putting flyers everywhere, and even going on TV.The abducter of Diane is Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). I don't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her, however, I will write that Barney contacts Jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate Diane after so many years. He gives Jeff a chance to experience what happened to Diane, but at a cost. Enter Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) who is also the latest love interest of Jeff. Her role in the film is very important. Barney Cousins is a sociopath, and he has been abducting women for some time. How long, the viewer is never told, but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction. He is very methodical.As I wrote in the beginnig, I have seen the original, and while it is quite good, this film also is a very good and suspenseful film. The character of the sociopath, played by Jeff Bridges is very good. He is very convincing in his part. As for Kiefer Sutherland, I thought he gave a very good performance. Disregard some of the negative reviews on this film. Just because the original is on Criterion, and in Dutch, does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film. I have the DVD, but it is only listed on VHS at amazon. It might be out of print. If you can, grab the DVD; I assure you that you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 4.5]"
227,dvd,"An extraordinary film, The Vanishing, brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the American Northwest.The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category.Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  The setting, the plot (Jeff's strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"
228,dvd,"This movie starts a little slow, but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller.  Bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little ""thing"" that just makes him creepy.  Typical of an early 90s thriller, this movie is sure to entertain.  If you liked ""Fear"" then you will like ""The Vanishing"" as well"
229,dvd,"George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying ""Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one. "
230,dvd,"    In 1988, director George Sluizer had directed a film entitled, THE VANISHING. The film was all in Dutch and starred Dutch actors, who are nowhere near well-known in this country.    In 1993, director George Sluizer, who had directed the original Dutch film, had decided to direct a remake of his own film, this time, casting a well-known cast that consists of Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock,  Jeff Bridges. The film is almost the same as the original Dutch version, but this one is much more worth the time and money.    JEFF HARRIMAN (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend, DIANE SHAVER (played by Sandra Bullock) are driving to the mountains for vacation. They have a little spout, after their car runs out of gas, while in a dark tunnel. Leaving Diane there, Jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station. He comes back to find Diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel, upset and distraught. They pull into a gas station, where Diane has Jeff, who laughs with cheerfulness, repeat an apology. They kiss passionately, where Diane heads into the store to buy her and Jeff some cold beers. A half-hour goes by and Diane has not yet returned. He searches the store, as well as the whole ground, but Diane is nowhere to be found.    Three years later, Jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend. Every month for the last three years, Jeff would renew the posters he had printed of Diane. He has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped Diane to tell him where she is. He walks into a diner one night, still very miserable, and meets RITA BAKER (played by Nancy Travis). Rita is instantly attracted to Jeff. Jeff and Rita begin a love affair together. Jeff tries to move on with his life, but he cannot, for he is still searching for Diane. Rita finds out about what Jeff is doing behind her back. She tries to help get over his obsession, but it doesn't work. Jeff receives a letter from a man named BARNEY COUSINS (played by Jeff Bridges). Jeff shows Rita the letter, but she realizes that his obsession is still going on, where she leaves him. She goes to their appartment, packs her things, changes the outgoing message on their answering machine. Jeff returns home and changes the machine himself, but as the recording is still going, Barney appears. Jeff beats the hell out of him, but Barney reveals that he can tell him where Diane is, and that in order for Jeff to find out what happened to her, he'd have to ride with Barney.    While at a bar with her girlfriend, Rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message, but Rita hears that Jeff had already changed it, to which she finds Barney's voice on the machine. She realizes that Jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him, but Jeff and Barney are already on their way.    Rita finds out what happened from her neighbor, where her neighbor gives Rita the license plate number to Barney's car. With this License Plate #, Rita finds out where Barney lives and drives off to his place.    Jeff and Barney arrive at the gas station where Diane was last seen three years earlier. Barney hands Jeff a cup of coffee, where Barney informs Jeff that the coffee is drugged. He tells Jeff that in order to find out what happened to Diane, Jeff has to go through the exact same details that Diane had gone through. Jeff, through hurtful tears, drinks the coffee and blacks out. He wakes up to darkness. He flips on his lighter to find himself locked...in a coffin and...buried alive outside Barney's vacation cabin in the woods. Barney had done this to poor Diane, who, after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid, is now dead.    Rita arrives at Barney's house, where she meets Barney's daughter, DENISE (played by Maggie Linderman). She asks Rita to giver her a ride to the carnival, as long as she doesn't say a word to to Barney. Rita asks Denise how to get to the summer cabin where Barney is at. Denise gives her the directions and Rita is on her way. She arrives and has a brief brawl with Barney. She stops when he is about to kill her. She is now seated inside his cabin, talking with Barney, trying to find out what he did with Jeff. She notices the dirt on his shoes, the dirt on a shovel, standing beside the door, and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass, and realizes that Barney had buried Jeff alive. She knocks Barney and begins digging up Jeff. But not before Barney awakens and begins brawling again with Rita. Did Jeff suffocate and bite the dust as Diane had done? Will Barney kill of Rita as well? The only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of THE VANISHING.    I have read the reviews from many Amazon.com reviewers and I cannot believe that anyone would hate this remake. So what? The ending was changed. I do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie. This movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake. Kiefer Sutherland, again, proves that he is the best actor on this planet, maybe even in this whole galaxy. This movie is one Kiefer's best starring roles and I recommend it to any Kiefer Sutherland fan who has not yet seen this film"
231,dvd,"This movie maybe a remake, but it keeps you at the edge of your seat.  You don't ever want to get up.  You always want to know what is going to happen next.  It is a great mystery and it is very realistic!  5 stars for a great movie"
232,dvd,"Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, ""The Vanishing"" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, ""what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie"". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie. And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of ""It has to be upbeat!"" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.       "
233,dvd,"I glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is ""intellectual"" because it is made anywhere but the USA.  In their eyes America can do no right.  My other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame. "
234,dvd,"Boyz n the Hood was one of the most important movies of the 1990's. It is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in Urban America where youth gangs run rampant. During the course of the story, it offers much needed commentary on thesituation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it.At the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says ""One out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime, most will be killed at the hands of another black male."" If anything, that fact is even worse today. Most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film, but many of thesefilms today are all shoot `em up movies that have no morality, strong plot or serious social message.The setting of this flick is South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer. Over the past two decades the Los Angeles Police Department has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3/4ths of the city's total.This gripping tale evolves around a single black father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), raising his one and only son, Trï¿½ Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and installing in him the values to help him become a man. This is an important point that director John Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The values that Furious Styles instills in Tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today.Essentially, Boyz n the Hood is a movie about peace. Its message is that violence isn't the answer, and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are other alternatives available. The movie starts when Tre's mother sends himto live with his father Jason, a/k/a ""Furious"", whois much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. The movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old Tre and his best friend Ricky about to graduate from high school, whileanother friend Doughboy has already graduated - fromshoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility and self-respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring. The basic plot to Boyz n the Hood is can Tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal, decent life? This is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him. Boyz n the Hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings. It shows thedire straits that folks in the South Central are in without being conscending or exploitative. Boyz n the Hood is a flick that is well written, acted and directed. The cinematography is stunning"
235,dvd,"This is truly a BRILLIANT movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the ""real"" hood is really like.  For me this was nothing less than educational.  I could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale (the hood) which they are powerless to escape or ignore.  This is more than just a movie, it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down, and exposes the humanity of the characters.  When watching the movie, I could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish --- these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood, but humans with hopes, feelings and aspirations, just like you and me.  What more can I say, except: BRAVO!"
236,dvd,"This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings.This movie truly captures the struggle millions of African Americans go through. As we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto, to when they are old enough to get out, they still seem to be the same. Their customs dont change, simply because of their surrounding, guns, liquor, poverty, and crime. They have no other option than do join in. When dough boy's(Ice Cube) brother Ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto. The whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also, so everyone is supporting him. Until a tragedy is brought upon the family. This story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys. "
237,dvd,"Good movie from the 1990s years,Tre has to live with his dad after getting into a fight with Bobby the boy he walked to school with, I like the part when Tre,ricky,doughboy and little Chris(or Chris)were young.The part when Doughboy said she loved that fool more than she loved me. I think it was pretty obvious.I think he said fool but if he did that ment ricky.But you know what ever!I know part of this review sounds stupid"
238,dvd,"Despite what some people might think, Boyz N The Hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle.  It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America.  I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie.  This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script.  Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne).  Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual.  Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube)  Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother.  The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends.  It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great.I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central.  I don't care where your from or what colour your skin is, you can enjoy and be moved by this film, a true masterpiece"
239,dvd,"Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie"
240,dvd,"Boyz N the Hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named Tre Styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of South Central Los Angeles. After a confrontation with a classmate at his school, Tre's mother forces him to go and live with his father Furious. She says, "" The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son."" She just can't take his problems anymore.After being dropped off at his fathers place, Tre grows through  5 more years of seeing what hood life is really like making him about 13 years old. All the while Furious tells Tre, ""You know Tre you may think I'm being hard on you right now, but I'm not. What I'm doing is trying to teach you how to be responsible. Its like your little friends across the street, they don't have anybody to show them how to do that. And you're gonna see how they end up too."" His next door neighbors Chris, Doughboy, and Ricky are very close and all grow up together learning how to survive the streets. Ricky is a high school all star football player and scholar who hopes to get into USC on a scholarship. Meanwhile his brother doughboy on the otherhand becomes a thug involved with a gang (the crips), pushing drugs, boozing 40s (OE), and running his mouth. Ricky and Tre both want to make something of their future while doughboy is just trying to survive. One night at the strip on Crenshaw, a group of bloods are strolling through, and one of them bumps into Ricky on purpose trying to start crap. He says, ""F*** you lookin at nigga?"" Ricky shouts back, ""I'm still trying to find out nigga!"" Doughboy hears the confrontation taking place, rushes up with his homeboys right by his side and says ""We got a problem here? We got a problem? He pulls aside his coat flashing a .45 concealed in his pants and flashes gang signs.The bloods flash gang signs back. Doughboy pulls back the slide on his gat (cocking it). The gangsters give him a dirty look, turn their backs and walk away. Right when the crowds are ready to leave, the bloods open the trunk of their tricked out hyundai and fire a fully automatic uzi in the air. Ricky and Tre drive off together saying, ""can't go nowhere without getting all shot up and crap."" They get pulled over and hassled by the cops. Tre drives over to his girlfriends house and he shows sad and angry emotions. She comforts him and they end up making love. About 15-20 minutes near the end of the movie, Rickys wife asks him to go the the convenience store to get some cornmeal. He walks a few blocks from his house with tre and walks out of the store with the cornmeal, a container of milk, and several lottery tickets. Ricky and Tre are walking back home and Ricky is totally unaware that his SAT scores for college are waiting for him when he gets home. He scored just enough to get him accepted into USC. The red hyundai pulls up on a side street and the bloods inside are saying, ""Theres that bastard that was talking smack the other night."" The gangsters grab their guns and the car peels out around the corner catching Ricky and Tre running and ducking into an alley near a wooden fence down the street. The fellas inside the car are shouting, ""Cut him off man. Lets kill him. Come on man, go."" The leader of the gang steps on the gas and the car races down the street after them. Doughboy and his homies are waiting on the porch chilling when the red car races past with its system booming.Doughboy knows something is up and he races inside, grabs his gat, and the guys jump into the car, racing to find Ricky  Tre. Ricky and Tre are walking down the alley. Ricky is finishing scratching off his lottery ticket when the car full of bloods pulls up. Tre shouts, ""RICKY!"" Ricky sees the car, drops his bag, and runs as fast as he can away from the car. By that time it is too late. A 12 gauge shotgun gets raised and blasts two shots. The first one hits him in the legs to cripple him and the 2nd shot hits him blowing a hole in his chest, knocking him to the ground. There is so much blood all over. Tre tries to comfort him Ricky and keep him concious as Doughboys car pulls up. Ricky dies in Tres arms and they take him home. Rickys mother comes unglued and the mom thinks that Doughboy is the one who shot him. She starts beating on him like crazy. Tre pulls him away from her on the porch. Tres clothes are covered from head to toe in blood and he tells Doughboy ""meet me at my house in 5 minutes."" Tres girlfriend tries to stop him to see whats up and he tells her to go home. Tre walks into his fathers bedroom and loads a .357 magnum. He wants to kill the guys responsible for murdering his best friend right in front of him.Furious does his best to stop Tre from commiting murder by confronting him in the living room and demands him to hand the gun over. Tre falls into his dads arms and begins sobbing. His dad says, ""Your my only son and I'm not gonna lose you to any crap. I love you man. Go clean yourself up. Go on."" Tre goes back to his bedroom knowing that his buddies are outside waiting for him in the car. He jumps out the window and runs to the car jumping in the back of the car. They race off and his father and buddy Chris are thinking, ""oh shoot."" Tres father is very nervous because he knows what the guys plan to do after the tragic  bloody afternoon. Tre does a lot of thinking in the backseat and orders his friends to pull over the car and let him out. They do as he wants. The guys in the car let him out and they drive off into the night looking for the thugs who murdered his friend. They pull into a burger joint and find the gangsters outside eating burgers at a table. They load  cock a fully automatic AK-47, turn off the lights on the car, and pull a drive by shooting on every single person at the table. The car comes to a screeching halt, doughboy cocks his sidearm and runs up to the surviving gangsters and murders every single one of them in cold blood. They peel out of the parking lot and the following morning Tre ends up talking to Tre about how hard it is to break the cycle of violence growing up in the hood. Doughboy says, ""They sure pushed the clock on Rick man. I ain't got no brother. Next thing you know somebody might try to smoke me. Don't matter though. We all gotta go sometime huh?"" Tre tries to comfort him by saying, ""Hey dough. You still got one brother left man."" Doughboy says, ""Thanks man."" Doughboy and Tre embrace with a hug. Doughboy walks away pouring out his bottle of OE as an homage to his mudered brother and then a message comes up on the screen saying ""2 weeks later doughboy is murdered."" How sad. Personally I didn't like the ending. It wants to get out the message that the violence never seems to stop. Tre  his girl survive and go to college out of state later in the fall. A very powerful and moving story that should be shown to every young man  woman near high school age. Although the movie has a lot of language and is very violent, it has an important message that needs to get across to everyone.""INCREASE THE PEACE"
241,dvd,"this iz da best drama movie of all time.Itz da truf nigga!!!!if ya black you must see it, if ya any other race go see it and see what black people has to go through in life."
242,dvd,"What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is ""I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job."" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, ""I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too."" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how ""real"" Furious was. ""Young"" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today. "
243,dvd,"""The Sentinel"" isn't a movie I entirely expected to like, although I've wanted to see it since it was in theatres. Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called ""Firewall."" Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to ""Firewall"" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is ""In the Line of Fire."" It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself ""that sounds/looks familiar."" I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time. Due to its flaws, with only the fact that I enjoyed it to support my case, I should give it 4 stars...But I think that it's worthy enough of 5.Entertainment goes a long way.GRADE: A"
244,dvd,I actually liked this movie and I don't understand the bad reviews maybe they were expecting a smarter movie I don't know. Anyways the plot was easy to follow and made some sense and the action was okay. I am not going into the movies detail because I don't want to ruin the story for somebody. I will recommend this movie to people and most will enjoy it but those crazy people that like perfect movies and complain about every detail will not enjoy it all. Rent it then maybe buy it if you like it
245,dvd,"Very good ,bu not as good as the other films of Michael Douglas.I dont understand the price.Why full screen is higher price than widescreen"
246,dvd,i purchased this movie basically to see my favorite chick Eva longoria but i ended up loving the movie i would recommend it to anyone
247,dvd,"Good movie, have always been a fan of michael douglasagain he has done some fine work"
248,dvd,Kiefer Sutherland does his usually excellent job and Michael Douglas was also very good. 
249,dvd,"I cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received.  Were they watching the same movie I was watching?  I generally concider myself very critical when it comes to political thrillers such as ""The Sentinel"", so I am not going to just generally give such a movie of one of my favorite genres a high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought.  ""The Sentinel"" is everything that an intense, well-crafted political thriller should be.  The acting is quite convincing and the suspense is riveting.  I guarantee you will be pinned to the edge of your seat through the entire film and then some.  Also, the scenario is extremely plausible, especially in today's world, with all the militant groups out there--from neo-Nazis to Islamic radicals--who would stop at nothing to make an assination attempt or terrorist attack against the President or some U.S. institution.  My advice is, before listening to the negative rants of the other reviewers of this film, go ahead and take a look at it yourself.  It's a safe bet that you will not be disappointed. "
250,dvd,"I own the first two volumes of the Lost Treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat. They are brilliant and I hope more volumes appear on a regular basis.Why though, must I suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get The Plays volume without buying them all over again?I suspect (and hope) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime I can only say that if you don't already own any of these and are a fan of Broadway, theatre or the performing arts in general, buy this today! A fantastic showcase of theatrical talent"
251,dvd,"I can't write a review because I had to send both CD's back because they would not play.  I just ordered another one yesterday, and here's hoping that will be okay"
252,dvd,"Being a farm boy from Illinois, ""the-ay-ter"" could have been in a foreign country and I would have never been wiser.  Area schools performed shows written especially for high schools (like ""Mississippi Melody"" and ""Up On Old Smokey"").  In 1971, I had just purchased a state-of-the-art reel to reel tape recorder and was anxious to do a bit of experimentation with it.  As fate would have it, I saw an ad on CBS for the 1971 Tony Awards telecast and thought I'd see what kind of sound quality I would get from the tinny little speaker on the television.  I had no idea the format for that year was to perform 1 song from each award-winning show using as many of the original cast members as possible.  Even though the sound quality was far less than perfect, I realized I had an audio tape of more original cast members singing songs from Broadway shows than I could shake a stick at.  And many of the songs were familiar from television variety shows like Ed Sullivan etc.  I went away to college taking my recording with me and thoroughly annoyed my dormmates with it.  It was good to listen to while cleaning my room--but I had the advantage that I could recall what was on the television screen.  Reel-to-reel fell by the wayside for 8-track, cassette tapes, and finally cd.  The tape became brittle and would break many times over and electronic manufacturers slowly pulled reel-to-reel from the market.  Now, 30 years later, I'm actually seeing the performances again (remember this was YEARS before home video recordings).  The 1971 broadcast is heavily used throughout Broadway's Lost Treasures I, II and III.  The telecast that year used the giant lighted years as the backdrop for the songs.  Plus I found out that things like a ""clunk"" in the audio of ""If I Were A Rich Man"" was not caused by me--but it was Zero Mostel hitting the stage wagon with his shoe.  One performance I can recall in particular that has not been used (yet) is the one where the female announcer says:  ""...then came the sparkling 'High Button Shoes' and every bit as lovely then as she is now:  Nanette Fabray...""  (So I guess there's still enough material out there for ""Broadway's Lost Treasures IV"").  Get all 3 dvds for your collection because it's nice to have something when you simply want to be entertained and don't want to be bothered with a story line. "
253,dvd,"Mandy Patinkin was shown only in one small part of ""Evita.""That was very disappointing and I thought by the title he would be one of the hosts or at least a larger segment of him in ""Evita."" So why was he advertised in the title? The show was put together very well and the quality of the color and the production is excelent. It had a 3D effect which is very prominent, especially, with the hosting of Jerry Orbach.The shows chosen were all of my favorites and so I was pleased with that part of the CD.  But not enough of Mandy Patinkin.I don't think that you should advertise this CD by using Mandy's name as a come on. It sure fooled me."
254,dvd,"I ordered this DVD when it first came out and I've been enjoying it ever since. All the performances are enjoyable- some more than others, but they are all wonderful nonetheless. Some of my pesonal favorites include:    Patti Lupone bringing down the house along with Mandy Patinkin and Bob Gunton doing the song ""A New Argentina"" from Evita. This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD.    Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in ""The worst Pies in London"" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street    Carol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational ""Before the Parade Passes By"" from Hello, Dolly!    Yul Brynner performing ""Shall We Dance?"" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress!    John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-""Hey There"" from The Pajama Game    Paul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in ""Kids"" from Bye Bye Birdie    Joel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song ""Willkommen"". This song never gets out of your head!    Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: ""All That Jazz"" and ""Nowadays"". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment.    Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song ""Lullaby of Broadway"" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street.    Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform ""Tomorrow"" and ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws.    Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-""Jellicle Songs"" and the classic ""Memory"". It is stunning to watch.    Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- ""Buenos Aires"" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron.    Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song""Applause"" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of ""hits home"" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals.    All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!           "
255,dvd,"I was at the '71 Tony Awards, broadcast in March of 1971, and I thought the marvelous night would have to live on in my memory.  And, then, lo and behold...we get this marvelous record of theater history.  Many of the performances were from the '71 broadcast..Zero Mostel, John Raitt, Robert Preston, Carol Channing, which was the Silver Anniversary of the Tony's, full of legendary performances from the history of the musical theater.  I'm so looking forward to the other DVD's of performances that were not included.  If you want to see the legends of Broadway perform their signature songs, then this is the tape for you"
256,dvd,"If you're a fan of musical theatre, you're almost guaranteed to find something you like on this DVD. Although the presentation is cheesy (with some awful bluescreen effects), the musical numbers themselves are entertaining.Highlights include Patti LuPone in Evita, Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera in Chicago and Bonnie Franklin in Applause. But for me, as a fan of both the musical theatre and science fiction, the higlight was seeing a young Nana Visitor (Major Kira on Star Trek Deep Space Nine) dance her little heart out in an impressive dance number from My One and Only. In this particular number, you will also see a less than comfortable Twiggy trying to keep up with the rest of the dancers. She looks so out of place next to Tommy Tune.One of the few performances I didn't like was Betty Buckley singing Memory from Cats. Her singing was okay, but I just didn't buy her as a ""cat""...Other than that, this DVD should warm the hearts of musical lovers around the world"
257,dvd,"It is very exciting to see these performances for the first time. I am more of a fan of Wicked and Hairspray but this was great! Too good to be true. I could have skipped the talking in between as it seemed forced and this is really one you buy just to see these stars doing what they are famous for. I love Mandy Patinkin and wish they still made musicals so he could be doing more of them in movies. Where was he in ""Chicago""? I mean Richard GERE?"
258,dvd,"""The Living Daylights"" is actor Timothy Dalton's first outing as the British super spy. He replaced Roger Moore, whom I regretfully have never seen in a Bond film. Actually, I've only seen 3 Bond films prior to this one.(Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever). One thing most Bond fans agree on is that Sean Connery was the best James Bond.I'd say that's accurate, but Dalton's approach to the character is far different from what we've previously seen. James Bond is, overall, an under developed character. He's a super-spy who loves martinis and women. In the films I've seen, James Bond is given no back story and shows little human emotion. Don't get me wrong, in this film there's no back-story either...But there is a little emotion. Anyway, the film has a great opening sequence; But, as usual, this sequence has little to do with the rest of the plot. It's merely used to get the audiences pumped for the rest of the story. The story involves Bond being hired as a sniper to protect a Russian officer named Georgi Koskov. Koskov is afraid that he is being targeted by a sniper; Bonds orders are to shoot any sniper he sees that poses a threat to Koskov. Well, Bond does see a sniper. Only the sniper is in the form a beautiful cellist named Kara (Maryam d'Abo, a really hot Bond girl). Making a last minute decision, Bond opts not to kill Kara and instead just wounds her. He then transports Koskov to a remote hiding spot. Koskov is then abducted from his hiding place and it's up to Bond to find him. As he does, with Kara's help of course, he uncovers a semi-complex weapons scheme. The plot is really nothing special, overall, but back to Dalton. In the previous Bond films, Bond usually woos a Bond girl and beds her. In this film, Bond seems to fall in love with her. Of course, there's no exchange of ""I Love You"" here; But the romance is a little different. The action sequences are good and the art direction is fantastic. It's nice to Bond in a normal place, like a fair. The scene where Bond and Kara have to escape from an Afghanistan prison is exciting. The film does have it's spot where it lags, but this is a worthy entry in the series. Hell, it's just nice to see a different side of James Bond. Another thing this film does is show a little more skin then you're used too. All the other Bond films use mere sexual innuendo; In this film, you actually side-nipple. GRADE: B+"
259,dvd,"The strong plot deals with a nasty agreement between a weapon ` mercenary and a Russian General, both of them are engaged in a dark red of corruption and illegal trades. Bond will have to face them until unmasking.This saga is loaded with admirable sequences, fabulous landscapes and an intriguing script. The first incursion of Timothy Dalton was very gratifying, because at last Bond returns to his origins, far from being a simple Cartoon character since Moore was hired.Recommended without reserves."
260,dvd,"I'm sure folks getting into Bond just skip by this one coz Dalton only did two films, and the assumtion is that his movies must suck if he only lasted for two.  Though Dalton isn't given much praise, I think he's quite good.  In fact, to date I have not seen a lousy Bond actor.  Each actor had something unique to contribute.  Dalton is alot more serious, which probably seemed like a shock after people had spent a decade with the comical Roger Moore.  Dalton makes a quip here and there, and of course he's required to in the scenes with Q.  Otherwise, in situations where Moore would have definitely had a sarcastic remark, Dalton remains silent.  Another thing-both Roger and Sean(and George for that matter) were a couple of horndogs-Dalton doesn't even seem that interested in women!  Aside from scoring a chick in the precredit sequence, Dalton looks as though he's ready to settle down with the lead actress!  Bond is up against a weasely Russian and a psycho arms dealer played by Joe Don Baker(Mitchell!!).  John Rhys-Davies gets thrown into the mix too.  It may not be quite as cool as License To Kill, but don't pass it by"
261,dvd,"For all the annoyance Roger Moore caused many Bond fans, he was still the face of Bond for 15 years, and became our comfortable successor to the role originally helmed by Connery.  Now that he FINALLY bowed out (after nearly decomposing in OCTOPUSSY and VIEW TO A KILL), the challenge was on to find the NEW James Bond.  Many hoped Pierce Brosnan would step into the role at this point, but alas he was still obligated to being Remington Steele on TV.  Somehow or other, Timothy Dalton got the role - a very odd choice indeed in that he never seemed to really even WANT the part!  Indeed, I would have to grudgingly argue that Dalton is my least favorite James Bond - he just never seemed to own the role the way his other peers did (even Lazenby in his ONE outing).  However, and ironically, his two films were some of the best the series had to offer, beginning with this definite Top Five contender.  TLD represented a return to the more espionage centered feel of the novels, and really only seen in the first two Connery films, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Moore's own FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  The main plot revolves around a power-hungry arms dealer and a secondary plot to assassinate secret agents around the world.   Along the way, Bond hooks up with a would-be assassin and has one of his few on-screen monogamous relationships.  This alone adds to the believability of the film.Somehow, the producers were able to delve into a rich espionage plot, yet still not skimp on the action.  This film is LOADED with action, including a new gadget-filled car (one of the better ones) and several exciting sequences involving the theft and eventual crash of a transport plane.  The only complaint I have with this film (aside from Dalton himself) is that the villain is pretty weak.  Joe Don Baker just doesn't have the screen presence to be a villain.  Ironically, he returns in GOLDENEYE and TOMORROW NEVER DIES as a good-guy, and fits THAT role much better! Jerome Krabb fairs a little better, but is generally more annoying than anything else.Marayam D'abo is nice as the Bond girl - attractive AND a good actress as opposed to the usual glamour models that may or may not be able to act (ahem - Barbara Bach - ahem).  This was the first Bond to replace Moneypenny - and the actress chosen was serviceable, but with little of the memorable flair that Samantha Bond has brought to the role in the recent Brosnan films.All-in-all, and Dalton not-withstanding, this is one of the best of the series, and is a welcome return to a grittier and more believable Bond - Dalton's follow up, LICENSE TO KILL would delve even deeper into the gritty side of Bond - too bad the Brosnan films came along and took us back into Super Bond territory!"
262,dvd,"The CD was great and extra scenes on the Cd were really good, however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen CD and I would have bought another! So I wasted $21.00 as I have a HD TV but not wide screen."
263,dvd,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie out of the series.  The Living Daylights is a Bond film that has depth and realism.  The film isn't the typical Bond movie.  It has a hardcore spy plot.  Other films in the series like this includes FRWL and OHMSS.  As an actor Timothy Dalton brought intensity and passion to the role. No other Bond has reacted to situations with human qualities like Dalton did.  For example,  in the fair scene Dalton jumps up abruptly with anger and ready to kill when he finds out that Saunders was murdered. Previous Bonds did not show emotion like this(with the exception of George Lazenby). Dalton's performance made the movie transcend the title of being ""just a Bond movie"".  In some Bond films (especially the Bronsnan entries) the gadgets, the action, the jokes, and the escapades overpower the movie's  plot.  That is not the case with The Living Daylights.  There is a balance between action and plot.  The humor is witty without taking away from the serious nature of the film.  After watching Roger Moore's parody and silliness it was refreshing to watch Dalton take a darker approach in The Living Daylights.  Dalton's monogamous approach also made the film stand out.  Throughout the film Bond stayed with one woman-Kara Millovy (The pre-credits woman doesn't count).  Also, an important aspect to me in a Bond film is a believable down-to-earth villain.  This film accomplished just that.  Necros, Yogi, and Brad Wittiaker made classic intelligent villains.  Cartoonish villains such as Jaws make me disgusted with the series.  In conclusion, if you want parody from a Bond movie watch entries like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun, and Diamonds are Forever. However, if you want to watch a Bond movie with substance watch this movie, License to Kill, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service"
264,dvd,"This was the first Bond film I ever watched, years ago when it premiered on ABC saturday night movies, so I have a soft spot for it. It's still definitely one of the best, with an intriguing plot that actually requires the viewer to pay attention without becoming too convoluted. Probably the most spy-centric story since From Russia With Love. Timmothy Dalton's take on 007 is the grittiest of all the Bond actors so far, and he manages to find a strong balance between realism and the larger-than-life antics of Bond. All the usual Bond trimmings are here too, including the cars, gadgets, John Barry score, and even a new actress as Moneypenny. There are some fantastic action sequences including the opening teaser, a car chase on ice, and a fight on a cargo plane. Dalton only made two 007 films before the series went on hiatus, and this is the stronger of the two. It lacks the dark tone that haunts his follow-up, Licence to Kill, and feels a bit more timeless. This is also a pretty good DVD. You get a making-of documentary, another documentary on Bond creator Ian Fleming, the retro A-Ha music video of the title song, and a fun deleted scene (probably cut as it seems like a bit of silliness leftover from the Moore years). The bad? No English subtitles, at least on my version. My version also lacks the original burned-in subtitles on an early sequence where a Russian agent seduces her supervisor to provide Bond with a distraction. It's a rather funny one-liner, and I heard MGM corrected this mistake on later pressings of the disc. The Living Daylights still remains one of my favourite Bond films, and is a must-buy for all fans. "
265,dvd,"This is by far the best non-Connery Bond film.  Timothy Dalton is brilliant in the lead role, giving Bond a menacing quality. It is a shame we only got to enjoy him as 007 in two films, because he was truly awesome.  As far as the basic standards for Bond movies, this one delivers the goods; beautiful women, explosions, car chases, exotic locations...the works! And, AND, we get to see James Bond and Miriam D'Abo skiing down a mountain in a cello case! What else could you want"
266,dvd,"The mystery of how well the new Bond would replace Roger Moore in the fifteenth ""official"" Bond movie was over with ""The Living Daylights.""  The style of the movie was set with the opening scenes, where three double-0 agents parachute onto Gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise.  Unfortunately, someone in the exercise is using real ammunition, not paint balls.  Timothy Dalton shows that he is made of Bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire, flies off a cliff, and explodes, with Bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts.Timothy Dalton was a no-nonsense Bond in this movie.  He eliminated the numerous one-liners that seemed to be a Roger Moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more spy-like Bond.  In this first of two Bond movies Dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either Sean Connery or Roger Moore, but he breathed new life into the series.The plot bears some characteristics of ""A View to a Kill"" in that both films portray the Soviet Union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder, gentler, Soviet Union.  This time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch, profiting by buying drugs from Afghanistan and selling them in the Soviet Union.  Unfortunately, the money belongs to the Soviet Union.Mixed into this plot is a Soviet defector, KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb).  Bond's mission was to get Koskov out of East Germany and into Berlin.  However, it appears that someone wants Koskov dead, as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill Koskov as he attempts to defect.  Bond has a chance to kill Kara Milovy, well played by Maryam d'Abo, but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead.The plot thickens during the debrief of Koskov.  Koskov tells British agents that General Leonid Pushkin, played by always excellent actor John Rhys-Davies, is executing a program to eliminate Britain's secret agents.  Unfortunately, KGB appears to retrieve Koskov from the English estate safe house and the British agents are unable to learn more.  Bond turns to Kara Milovy.  Bond leads Kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet Koskov, her patron.  However, Bond has yet to learn where Koskov is.What follows is an action-packed movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end.  There is an excellent battle scene in Afghanistan (filmed in Morocco), and an even better escape scene from Afghanistan.  After all that action there remains one loose end to tie up, which Bond does nicely.During the film we meet another excellent supporting actor, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, an Afghani chief.  We also meet Joe Don Baker as self-centered Brad Whitaker.  There is yet another version of Felix Leiter, this time a less than memorable version of Leiter.  Caroline Bliss is a mediocre version of Miss Moneypenny.The special effects were much more down-to-earth versus those in ""A View to a Kill.""  The ubiquitous Aston-Martin returns with rockets, rocket boost, outriggers, and sundry other gadgets.  There is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin.  The same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool.  This film also featured exploding milk bottles.  The way Koskov escapes from East Germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons, including the use of a Harrier vertical takeoff jet.  In general the special effects were well done and believable.There are a few moments where I noticed some scene glitches.  It appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the four-engine C-130 Bond was flying had two engines.  In another scene in the plane Bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank.  However, the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window.  Perhaps Bond also has x-ray eyes.  In yet another scene Kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the C-130, which is impossible due to the configuration of the C-130's ramps.  However, these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent.The special edition DVD includes a deleted scene where Bond rides a flying carpet.  I will leave you to discover how that stunt was performed.  The reason given for its deletion was the length of the movie.Keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song, A-Ha sings ""Living Daylights.""  A-Ha was popular in Europe at the time, and had a huge hit in the United States with ""Take on Me.""There is irony in that the James Bond films are filmed in the same country that is the origin of Dr. Who.  One could start to think that James Bond is like Dr. Who, incarnating as different people over time.  Timothy Dalton was the fourth ""official"" Bond.  Each of the Bonds has had their own style and abilities, and each have generally been well exploited.  Fortunately for viewers, Timothy Dalton's Bond was a more austere Bond, living up to the tradition of the Ian Fleming novels.  He was smart, athletic, and confident without being arrogant.  This Bond movie remains above average for the genre, and enjoyable to watch multiple times."
267,dvd,This movie is really funny and Vince Vaughan is just great in it. It is good to watch when you need to laugh.
268,dvd,"I didn't watch this one beforeBecause of all the hypeToo many buddy comediesWere coming through the pipeThis one caught me by surpriseIt really was first rateTwo dudes who're crashing weddingsSo they'll always have a dateFast-talking party animalsWith very rigid rulesBreak it off before sunriseCommitment's just for foolsUntil one day one falls in loveThe other falls in lustIf you want to see Vince Vaughn get hurtThen this one is a mustSometimes sappy, sometimes sweetand often lewd and loudbut it doesn't stoop to flatulenceso it stands out from the crowdAmanda Richards, November 5, 2006"
269,dvd,"""Wedding Crashers"" starts off slow, I thought it was going to be a disaster of a movie, but I was wrong. By the end, the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch. Yeah, this movie is overhyped a little, but it is still a really good movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are raally great in their roles on this film. It's not a film you have to really think about, it is just a good comedy."
270,dvd,"John and Jeremy party hearty crashing weddings, until, of course, the inevitable happens: They fall in love themselves.  I watched this flick while planning my wedding and enjoyed it so much I've been tempted to try it...kind of sorry nobody crashed mine! Great romantic comedy. THe added features, which include Chaz' Rules Of Wedding Crashing, make this DVD well worth the buy"
271,dvd,"The opening sequence with Dwight Yokum and Rebecca De Mornay is one of the funniest in the film. The rest doesn't live quite up to it. The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite!Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film.Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics.Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie.The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these ""buddies"" looking a bit too disconnected.Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it. It is very formulatic and if you're smart, you'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy. (over 2 hours)PS: Will Ferrell turns in a very odd performance as Chazz Reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher. You might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character."
272,dvd,"The Wedding Crashers is one of the modern breed of rom-coms (along with Hitch) that actually appeals to men as well as women. The formula is simple, amuse the guys by showing the male lead as a chauvenistic womaniser, then please the chicks by having him turn into the gushing romantic hero who falls for the female star. It basically means juvenile toilet humour for the first half of the film before the transition into unrealistic gushing soppy romance that never actually happens in real life in the second half. I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit sappy towards the end"
273,dvd,This video gives straight forward and useful information on shooting digital photography in various sports settings.  I found it very useful. 
274,dvd,I have many books about digital sports photography and they don't even come close to this DVD in regard to practical application.  The title of this DVD is so on target.  It is 'simple' to use the settings suggested and it pays off immediately.  This is an excellent DVD and well worth the cost.  (I wish the same people made one about digital portrait photography.)  To ALL Parents of Athletes: BUY THIS DVD. Only buy the books if you want to go into professional sports photography. 
275,dvd,"Teaching photography I have seen quite a few how-to videos, and this one is the best so far. It is well thought-out and produced. It takes the view point of an amateur photographer (Mom and/or Dad photographing the kids playing various sports), but has many concepts that could just as easily apply to professionals. Equipment wise he does expect a digital SLR with a minimum of a 200mm lens. Sorry no point-and-shoots allowed. Otherwise I would highly recommend this video"
276,dvd,"I'm new to using an SLR and this DVD was the perfect training video.  This video tells you what equipment you need, how to set it up, where to position yourself, and how to shoot for the best results.  With my new camera and this information, I immediately was able to produce good shots during basketball and baseball games.  Well worth the money"
277,dvd,"Of all the instruction and training I've received over the years, I thought this was one of the best, if not the best, instructional DVDs I've ever seen. Doug Jensen has really set the bar. Every aspect of it was extremely well done - scripting, structure, use of stills and video, video camera work (I'm a video producer myself, so I paid particular attention to that) audio (often a weak point in DVDs) and the use of graphics (I really liked the 'through the viewfinder' parts - where sports action video is shown framed in a SLR viewfinder) - even the glossary was helpful in reviewing terms and also the explanation of the digital photo histogram. Plus, it was loaded with tons of practical tips and advice - the kind of things that a really experienced photographer tells you one-on-one, when they want to help you out. For someone like me who is transitioning from a film 35mm SLR to digital SLR - it was really helpful to clarify the concept of EV (Exposure Value) and the interplay of ISO, shutter and aperture. Yeah, I knew what they were - but to see the relationship ""in action"" and how it changes from shutter priority to aperture priority (depending on the shot) really reinforced the concepts. If you buy only one resource for digital sports photography - this should be it. It has a permanent place in my DVD reference library"
278,dvd, I love this movie. It came out a couple of years after I personally had some what of the same experiences. I had a baby when I was 15 and my boyfriend and I split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later (married at 17) so unlike what 'Rochelle O'Gorman' says (who gave the Editorial Review on this movie) teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality. I think it is a good moral story that shows it is possible to make it and stay together even when you do get together and have a baby young. 
279,dvd,For when you need a little Molly Ringwald fix that 16 candles just won't satisfy. Fantastic!
280,dvd,"I am MOLLY RINGWALD's Fan,I have two  Laserdisc OF FOR KEEPS 1988 [ NEW ] And Used,I love it much thats why I bought it on DVD TOO,You won't regret it :"
281,dvd,I have always loved this movie.  Too me it is a comfort movie because I have seen it so many times growing up.  I recently let my 13 year old neice watch it and she loved it too.  I didnt think she would like it that much because its a big time 80's flick but she loved it.  Now she wants to watch it everytime she comes over
282,dvd,"Molly Ringwald shines in this film as she portrays a high school senior who ends up pregnant. She and the father get married and try to stick it out... she tries to work while pregnant, he tries to help his dad out... nothing seems to work. They get their own place and have to deal with their electricity being shut off so they end up moving in with her mother, which is difficult for everyone.Molly's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he's willing to give it up to help her with the baby, but she doesn't want him to. In the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does.Mixed in with the humor and comedy, there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young. It's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from"
283,dvd,This is really one of my favorite Molly Ringwald  movies...of course all of them great...this one stands out a lil more ...Its a more serious role of something thats happening everyday...I was also excited this came to dvd....I give her alot of props for this one
284,dvd,"For Keeps where shall I start.  For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network.  Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film).  The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant.  They struggle to stay together.  I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture.  It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times.  The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up.  Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection"
285,dvd,"I LOVE this movie and I was so worried it would never get to DVD since not many people have even heard of it. Its one of those movies that you can watch in your PJ's over and over. I just think of it as a comfort movie, I'm sure plenty of people would think thats crazy but I really like it =o"
286,dvd,"I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the ""burger"" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry..."
287,dvd,"I've been a Mr Show fan for decades. I saw Bob and David (not Dave) in concert in Twin Falls, Idaho back in 1989. They were a bit raw, but what they lacked in polish they made up for in sincerity and harmony. Some people want to call them the next Bob  Ray or Rowan  Martin or even Goldberg/Williams/Crystal. I say peeshaw! Bob has more talent in his ankle (left) than all of those jerks combined. And for David (not Dave), he's an example of how to live your life even when your body is being ravaged by HPV. I hope Lifetime will listen to its viewers and bring this back"
288,dvd,"I had never watched Mr. Show up  until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on TBS slightly edited.  I was hooked and began recording every episode on Tivo, until I realized they seemed to be edited so I picked up the 4th season and loved it, there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing, my favorite being the story of Everest.  I finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times, and while I found myself laughing out loud often, I didn't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season, aside from one or 2 sketches, not too much really stick out like the majority of season four.  A must own if you're a true fan of the show, for the commentary alone"
289,dvd,"Mr. Show, simply put, funniest, most intelligent skit show OF ALL TIME.

290,dvd,"It could be argued that the brilliant and equally bizarre Mr Show, had a very limited, niche appeal...although I'm unsure as to why exactly. Well, that's not entirely true, as I have a pretty good idea of why that is...or was. Maybe the explanation lies within the inherent properties of average TV audiences being... well, why even delve into it, eh?Allow me to slather on high praise: I miss Bob and Dave. Bob was recently doing some late-Friday-night-oddball-flick-hosty thing on Sundance Channel. In fact, it was there that I saw the movie he directed, ""Melvin Goes To Dinner,"" which I enjoyed. But I digress...Mr Show was original, intelligent, hysterical. Thank your lucky stars that the goodness of Mr Show's hijinks have been preserved in this format for you to enjoy whenever the mood strikes you.Break this DVD out at a party and silently muse over the obtuse, slack-jawed faces. Y'all are truly brutalizin' me."
291,dvd,"This is the fourth time I have watched this first and second season of Mr. Show, and I must admit, it is one of those rare programs that continues to get funnier and funnier each time that you watch it.  Literally, you catch something new and fresh each time it is placed inside of your DVD player.  What makes this series work better than most other television comedies out there is the chemistry of the cast.  Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are perfectly matched while also being completely random choices for the hosts of the show.  I had not heard about either of them before watching this series (which I bought due to a recommendation from a friend), now I have watched Melvin Goes to Dinner several times and listened to David Cross' stand-up comedy whenever I need a very social pick-me-up!  Needless to say, I have full submersed myself into their world after watching this groundbreaking series.What continues to work with this program is that the jokes are not your typical slapstick humor that the average ""Joe"" can get from watching reruns of Friends on NBC.  Mr. Show is hard hitting, in your face, political, yet not so political, social satire about the world around us.  While you may just see this as just another comedy show, I see it as so much more.  The cohesiveness of the skits and the underlying message throughout each show seem to represent the voices that we hear coming from our local papers on a daily basis.  They are not afraid to take a delicate issue and twist it into a hysterical moment.  The brutal honesty of David Cross makes this show thoroughly enjoyable while the approachable Bob Odenkirk brings it to our level.  Also, the interweaving of comic geniuses throughout the show keeps you wanting more.  Jack Black is a regular on the program (and really proves why he is funny), and there are appearances by Dave Foley, Sarah Silverman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Patton Oswalt, Julia Sweeney, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Stiller, Conan O'Brien, and Andy Richter.   This is not a show for everyone, but it does showcase the beauty of HBO and the ability that they have to see, and go forward, with avant-garde comedy. My favorite episodes were the News Report featured in the extras, Operation Hell on Earth, and If You're Going to Write a Comedy Scene, You're Going to Have Some Rat Feces in There, and the infamous milk machine joke song with Jack Black!   Utterly hysterical. (no pun intended)This DVD set of the first and second seasons is packaged very well.  With every season uncensored (were they ever with HBO), you get Mr. Show as it should be and will always be remembered.  It also is chalked full of extras that will quench every drop of Mr. Show that resides in you.  The news report that they do in the extras portion of this DVD is worth buying alone.  Again, it shows the creativity and originality of a program that knew no boundaries.  I cannot wait to get my hands on the other seasons and fully explore the world in which I live ... which is the world showcased continually on Mr. Show.  The absurdity of our culture is redefined with this program.Grade: ***** out of ****"
292,dvd,"I started watching Mr Show on HBO in it's 3rd season on HBO and loved it.  I ran accross the DVD for seasons 1  2 together and in a fit of nostalgia decided to get it.  It was on of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.  These men are geniuses, although not everybody gets their brand of comedy.  It was fun seeing Jack Black on one of the early episodes as well"
293,dvd,"My favorite movie is The Diary of Anne Frank. (1959). Why? This is a movie about a 13 year old girl and her family that hides with her family and 4 other people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to escape from the Nazis during World War 2 because they are Jewish.The characters consists of Mr., Frank, Mrs. Frank, their daughters  Margot and Anne. Then there are the Van Daans, and their son Peter. Also, there is a crabby old dentist. And they have the helpers, Mr. Kraler and Miep. They help the people in the secret annex get food and clothing. Later in the movie, Anne falls in love with Peter, the Van Daans' son. They tell each other everything. *Beware, at the end, Peter and Anne kiss a couple of times, and everybody is arrested and taken to conceratiain camps. Mr. Frank is the only survivor. "
294,dvd,Read the book..had to see the movie.  This item hardly needs my review.  It is and always be one the greatist stories ever told
295,dvd,"Restored to its original 180 minute roadshow length (including overture and exit music), George Stevens' CinemaScope production of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (1959, Fox) is a deeply moving and superbly acted movie experience.  Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett adapted their Broadway show, with a brilliant Joseph Schildkraut  (Otto Frank) and Gusti Huber (Mrs. Frank) repeating their stage roles.  Added to a great cast are a very poignant and natural young Millie Perkins as Anne, Oscar winner Shelley Winters, Oscar nominee Ed Wynn in a bitter dramatic role, Diane Baker, and Richard Beymer as Anne's boy friend.It is heartrending material--a German Jewish family hiding out from the Nazis for two years in a Dutch attic, with Anne keeping a daily diary that was curiously ignored by the Nazis and has become one of the most important Holocaust documents.  (Maybe the same God who unforgivably let Anne and her sister die in a concentration camp only one month before war's end helped hide her diary for posterity.)  Location filming was done in the actual Amsterdam attic, with the real Otto Frank as technical advisor.  The Oscar-winning B art direction re-creates the actual two story attic interior to perfection (on huge Fox sound stages), and Oscar-winning cinematographer William Mellor (PEYTON PLACE) worked miracles to make wide CinemaScope compositions look cramped and claustrophobic. Producer/director Stevens gives it all a nail-biting tension, even though we know the grim outcome because of the powerful opening and closing framing device.Bonus material is outstanding--a feature-length documentary ""Echoes From the Past."" new interviews with George Stevens, Jr. (who was second-unit director in Amsterdam) and a still-beautiful 66 year old Millie Perkins, and Movietone Newsreel footage.  You will need two evenings for this film masterpiece that was nominated for eight Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, BEN-HUR, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER.  That was some movie year!  DIARY OF ANNE FRANK is an unforgettable Holocaust drama and movie experience when you have a three hour time slot."
296,dvd,"Detached as I am when watching movies, this one truly grabbed my heart and never stopped squeezing, the juice pouring out of my eyes in the form of sympathetic tears.This movie is great in all departments--acting, writing, directing, and editing. Based on some of the previous reviews, I expected an amaturish performance from Millie perkins. No way. She was wonderful, expressing the gamut of teenage emotions and evoking from me a caring, understanding response. Her only weakness is in her voice-over narration--it's a bit stiff, never transcending the sense of someone reading rather than just talking naturally. But this this is greatly overshadowed by the subtleties of her acting, which absorbed me thoroughly. THIS IS A MOVIE WORTH SEEING MANY TIMES--SO ABSORBING IS THE STORY AND THE CHARACTERS"
297,dvd,"This is a beautiful and very touching dramatization about a gifted, young German Jewish girl whose family had to go into hiding in order to avoid being captured and killed by the Nazis. The characters of Miep Gies and Kraler--Otto Frank's co-workers who hid the family at this horrible time and place--are very, very positive, as well. The film stars Millie Perkins (Anne Frank,) Richard Beymer as Peter Van Daan,) Ed Wynn (Dussel) and Shelley Winters (Mrs. Van Daan) who won an award for this as best supporting actress. All were absolutely brilliant. The film is a work of art that won several academy awards. I cannot recommend highly enough this remarkable and brilliant work--as positive and human as Anne herself."
298,dvd,"While millions of unfortunate people were marched off to Nazi death camps during World War II, the Franks and the Van Daans savored their moment in hiding until they were discovered in August 1944 after an informer had tipped off the SS. Millie Perkins played the title role of Anne Frank, a girl in her teens who wished for a happy life and did her best to bring happiness to her family during a tumultuous time in the course of history.In the two years the eight people were cooped up in a secret hideout on the top floor of a building located in the heart of Amsterdam, Anne kept up with her education and had the dream of one day to become a writer. She began writing a diary of her daily experiences of what she learned in life and how she coped with the boredom while in hiding. She had a courtship with Peter Van Daan as their relationship grew stronger toward the end when the SS broke through the secret entrance arresting all eight people.Anne died of typhus within two months of Nazi Germany's surrender while interned at the infamous Bergen-Belzen death camp. Her father, Otto, was the only one of the eight to survive the Holocaust, returning to the former hideout where he found his daughter's diary to have it published. He resided in Canada until his death in the 1980s.I visited the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam during the summer of 1977 before seeing this film for the first time the following year. Seeing the layout of the actual hiding place, I could picture how everything was while watching the film. Though a part of history, reflecting back to that dark era is painful for some people who had experienced the Holocaust and Nazi persecutions. Someone once said of the Nazi era that it is the things we want to forget most that we try the hardest to remember."
299,dvd,"Is a very interesting adaptation of this famous Diary, that shows the life of Anne and her family, when they were hide from Nazis on WWII. I recommend it. Canadian and mexican customers, be careful, neither spanish or french audio tracks were included, but you can select the subtitles"
300,dvd,"For those of you who may be reluctant to buy this because of the specifications listed on the back of the box, let me set your mind at ease.  While the box states Widescreen format (Aspect Ratio 2.35:1), it is actually anamorphically (16x9) enhanced.  And even though it states English stereo, it is actually dolby digital 4.0  There is no English mono or Spanish and French language tracks.  And the commentary track includes Millie Perkins even though she's not listed.  The movie looks beautiful and sounds great"
301,dvd,"My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss.  Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD.  Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion.  Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it.  One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld.  The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin.  This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it.  According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history.  So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge.  On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a ""disease.""  Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software.  ""Westworld"" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES.  This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes).  So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect.  Even the bad guys seem familiar.  Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer.  They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl.  Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree.  The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner.  A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development.  I am normally opposed to remakes.  For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films.  The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake.  But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original.  The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life.  As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive.  For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs.  The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects.  The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle.  My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum.All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film.  It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation:  JURASSAIC PARK.  Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks.  Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie. "
302,dvd,"special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment.      welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as ""to far out there,no one will believe it"" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest.  the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie"
303,dvd,"A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood.  Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World.  Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale.  Seriously, why is somebody not making this already"
304,dvd,I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night.  She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film.  One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene.  I like chase scenes.    Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection.A few good comic shots.  Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break. 
305,dvd,"I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK!After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the ""robots attack people"" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL.I FEEL CHEATED!   "
306,dvd,It was a great movie.  If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there.  I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real.  It was a movie worth buying
307,dvd,"In the future, there is a special adult themepark called ""Delos"" which has three different area adventure worlds which are ""Medieval World"", ""West World"", and ""Roman World"" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them.Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of ""Jurassic Park"" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on ""The Terminator"", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called ""Itchy and Scratchy Land"".The DVD has decent picture  sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi.Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1  2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall"
308,dvd,"Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds star in this film centering on the heyday of the porn industry in the 70s and 80s.Mark Wahlberg stars as Eddie Adams, a [..]bus boy working at a nightclub washing dishes.  One of the club's most frequent visitors is Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a porn movie producer who comes to the club looking for new actors.  Rollergirl (Heather Graham) also works at the club and is one of Horner's most popular actresses.One night, Jack goes into the back to talk to Eddie and soon the two become friends.  Jack tells Eddie all about the porn business, and Eddie is immediately intrigued.  Eddie has nothing to lose, since his parents threw him out of the house with just the clothes on his back.  Eddie accepts jack's invitation to act in one of his films and soon he is submurged in the world of [..] movies.His costar in his first movie is Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a very close friend of Jack's who lives in his house with him.  Eddie has a very successful session with Amber, and soon he sees his career begin to skyrocket.  Due to his new-found success, Eddie decides to change his name.  He settles on Dirk Diggler.For several years, Dirk is living in the limelight, making lots of money, and filming lots of x-rated movies.  However, success begins to take its toll, and Dirk delves into the world of drugs and alcohol.  Dirk's hard-driving life catches up to him and he has a major falling-out with Jack, who has replaced him with a new main actor called Johnny Doe.  Dirk's downward spiral continues, and he and his best friend Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) are involved in a shoot-out with an over-drugged thug who likes to listen to Night Ranger music.Dirk survives, but he realizes his life is a mess.  He decides to try to make amends with Jack, and Jack and Amber welcome him back with open arms.  After their reconcilliation, Dirk resumes his role as Jack's main star.I thought this was a very good movie.  Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds give fine performances.  The plot is very good and does a good job of showcasing the porn industry at the height of its success.I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and get a feel for what it was like to be a porn star"
309,dvd,"'Boogie Nights' does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what 'Nashville' did to country music.  It shows the underside of the glamour presented.  The film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the ""high life,"" then pulls the rug out from under it.  We see the usual suspects and the usual draws:  There's money, fame, lust, passion, and drugs.  But these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore.  The seemingly long, drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists.  It is superficial, and all of life's best elements seem to go out the window. There is the calculated cheesiness of the producer (Burt Reynolds) and his odd detatchment from his craft.  He both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him.  He meets a young aspiring hopeful (Mark Wallberg) who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home.  His naivete' is striking, and he doesn't entirely change in his innocence, only becoming a casualty of it.  (The way he practices to become the next Bruce Lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life.)  His new success doesn't make him all that happy, including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate.  The aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone, except the calloused producer, a casualty in a different way.  One fellow porn star (Don Cheadle) demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a hi-fi business, but the decent, conventional world won't let him.  Similarly, a fellow porn creator (William Macy) shows tragically that love transcends lust, even when it won't ever become realized.  A female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle.  If we aren't convinced near the end of the movie, then a ""candid camera"" scene between ""Rollergirl"" and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry's false promises for true happiness.The initial draw to 'Boogie Nights' may be deceptive.  It presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable, but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness."
310,dvd,"This is a movie loosely based on 70's and 80's porn star John Holmes. In this version, a young man name Eddie Adams is approached by porn director Jack Horner. Eddie then turns famouse and leads into a downward spiral including drugs and violence. This movie features many stars of the late 90's and today, including Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams, Burt Reynolds at Jack Horner, John C. Reilly as Reid Rothchild, and Julianne Moore as Amber Waves. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore were nominated for oscars for their breakthrough performance. This movie was also nominated for Best Writing to Paul Thomas Anderson for an oscar.The Extras on this DVD are good: 10 Deleted Scenes, a Music Video, 2 Commentary tracks, and the John C. Reilly Files"
311,dvd,"A film about the porn industry in the late 70's early 80's. Great Cast, Great Performances, Great Story, just a Great Film. Unique approach to the subject, characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion ,characters played by Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, and Burt Reynolds respectfully, are great to watch. This is a performance piece"
312,dvd,"Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.  Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is as excessive and stylish as you'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example).  Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk's room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences.  Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade.  This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer's row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors.  That said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like.  The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk's ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber's attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story.  Since there isn't really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack's House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of the '80's; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad's house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions.  This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory.  It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80's songs on a mixtape.  From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control.  Molina's over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge.  I wouldn't say Molina turns in the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie.The '80's are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one.  Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling.  All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form.  Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away.  Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn't care."
313,dvd,"The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be ""artistic"" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his ""package.""  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film ""seems"" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.   One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me"
314,dvd,"Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story),but this is ""Boogie Nights"".I can't say this movie was ""over-looked"", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, ""Fan-f**k-ing-tastic"".Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form.What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people.Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works.I can't hear ""Sister Christian"" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will)Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive.If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it"
315,dvd,"I was very impressed with this story. I saw it in the theater, and also have this version on DVD.  This is one of the most intense, longest, fulfilling movies available on the topic of the pornography industry in the 70's and 80's.  Very stylistic and (un)believable.  A (c)ockumentary of superior proportions.  But it wasn't really a documentary, just a Hollywood movie, based on a time, when porn was coveted by the raincoat crowd.  When I say (un)believable, I mean the story truely is unbelievable, in that the porn industry is not a man actor's world, but clearly belongs to the female actor.  She is the star in this industry.  So, when I see a movie like this, I worry for the young men out there, who think that they are the next ""Dirk Diggler.""  While, I'm probably over worrying the concept, I still hope that my words reach some man out there.  This is not reality.  This is a fantasy, conceptualized by a Hollywood Director; and nothing more.In reality, this could have easily been a story written about a female actress, such as Rollergirl?  Interesting enough, the director fell into the cliche, making Rollergirl, a victim.  Chastised by her Highschool classmates, and ran out of school.  But in reality, we in the know, know that it is the Jenna Jameson's and Tera Patrick's who are the real starts.  I give this one 5 stars though, as it really is an over the top effort by the director.  I was quite impressed.Two hard ones up!  This movie rocks!MC White said: Check it out!!"
316,dvd,one word INTERESTING and for the ending VERY INTERESTING...I was a bit iffy about this movie before i watch it but it was actually a good movie..
317,dvd,"Boogie Nights is one of those films, in the vein of Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Requiem for a Dream, that stares unflinchingly at something ugly and asks us to follow along without blinking.  When it's the porn industry, it's hard not to blink.It's the swinging 70s, and porn is on the rise.  Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), is a fresh-faced lad with a particular gift.  That gift happens to be in his pants.  His reputation is well known, but it's only when porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers him that Dirk's career takes off.  And thus begins a bizarre journey into the seedier side of filmmaking, complete with diva-level antics, arguments about video technology, and lots of sex and drugs.What's alternately curious and interesting about the film is that this is a traditional rag to riches story, only it happens to involve porn.  Dirk is portrayed as having a natural talent, a trait every character observes with deadly seriousness.  His talent, and the dedication to his ""art,"" elevates the entire porn industry itself, from merely badly filmed shaky-cam sex films to dramas with plot and character development.  Well, what passes for character development in porn, anyway.There's Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a porn queen barred from seeing her own children and subsequently mother to everybody. Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) is Dirk's right-hand man and frequent co-star.  Rollergirl (Heather Graham in her best acting role yet), does it with her roller skates on.  All the time.  Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is a black porn star that wants to live the American dream of owning his own business.  And finally, we have Little Bill (William H. Macy), assistant director to Horner and married to a utterly hedonistic woman who does it with everyone, everywhere, at any time. By the time we get to the 80s, several characters are dead, video is king, and Dirk is too hopped up on drugs to notice that it's affecting his performance.  A falling out with Horner leads Dirk to strike out on his own, trying to be anything but a porn star.  Unfortunately, Dirk's only good at one thing. And it takes him most of the movie to figure out what that is.Horner, Waves, and Dirk creates their own twisted, happy family.  Incapable of living in society separately due to the stigma of what they do, they form a kinship that only they can share.  And even they have their own bonds and boundaries; to their work, to themselves, to each other.  Those that cannot define who they are end up dead or in prison, or worse.  In the end, Boogie Nights is about making good with what you've got.  And yes that means even porn stars sometimes have to face facts: sometimes you're best talent is having sex on camera. The question becomes what a 17-year-old kid turned porn star is supposed to do about it.  Boogie Nights answers it in the final scene, when the true star of the film is unzipped to stare us in the face"

319,dvd,"Upon my viewing of Zoo TV: Live in Sydney"" at the tender age of ten, it is secure to articulate that I was most enamored with U2.  Now being twenty-one years of age, this particular show still draws me.  Despite having been previously stated before in aforementioned reviews, U2 are unquestionably at their best.  That is not to declare that U2 attained their peak during the Zoo TV Tour, quite the contrary, for their tours succeeding have been and are just as extraordinary.  After it was announced that Zoo TV should finally be released onto DVD, a U2 fan such as I could not facilitate but express delight and make purchase with all haste.  I highly recommend this product.  "
320,dvd,"This title was actually one of the first DVDs announced for the DVD format back in 1997.  If you can find an old copy of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" or other PolyGram DVDs of that era in their unique ""slide-down"" polycarbonate cases, you can see a brief preview of what this DVD was supposed to be. Unfortunately, PolyGram cancelled it shortly before it was supposed to be released, and it has been the Holy Grail of U2 fans for the past 9 years. Until it came out, the best format this was available on was CLV laserdisc, with none of the bonus stuff"
321,dvd,"Simply put, 5 stars is NOT ENOUGH to describe this DVD. I will spare all the  details, as they've pretty much been written already. Just go get this thing, now!"
322,dvd,"Great concert i remember this tour ,for me is the best tour because u2 visit the first time my country,Mexico"
323,dvd,"The 90's Quadrilogy of Achtung Baby,Zooropa,The Passengers(released under that psuedonym)and Pop are the last daring albums of U2's career. This concert footage parodies not only U2's celebrity, but celebrity in general. With banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage, the band was mocking it's own ubiquity. Sadly, they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour"
324,dvd,"Finally we get zoo TV on DVD great stuff great looking back on this tour brought back memories, I think bono sounds pitchy and off key in most of this DVD not his best vocals by far ,but otherwise a great concert"
325,dvd,"Well, finally we've reached the end of the ""yellow brick road"" and have ourselves a great DVD release with this AWESOME concert out of Oz, Nov 1993.  I love how this band still gives the fans what they want (check that:  NEED lol)  and release great great great DVD's of their live shows!  I mean, I am a Prince fan also (not as much as I was was I was 14)and that guy has BARELY let out any of his spectacular concert shows!(""Syracuse '85"", ""Sign O' the Times"", ""Rave 2000"", and now ""Alladin Live""---that's it??)  out on VHS or DVD.  ""Alladin""  ""Rave"" were the ONLY DVD releases, well officially anyways.U2 could and would put out a LIVE anthology boxed set - 1979-2006 if they wanted to and it would not have to be culled from any of their already released live DVD/VHS releases(ie ""Zoomerang Sydney"", ""POPMART Mexico City"" etc)I mean the MIND BOGGLES at the possibilities!  But what has come out has been quality AND quantity!  I mean they put out the fabulous ""Chicago 2005"" show last year (SAME year it was recorded -in MAY!) and there is talk of ANOTHER ""Vertigo Tour"" DVD (forgot what show -I wanna say another Mexico City) this year too!  I mean we U2 fans have it too damn good!  I know a forthcoming ""Popmart"" DVD release is due probably next year. And like this DVD they will put out a great transfer with fun bonus material and really capture the ""era"" it represented.  ""ZOO TV"" and ""POPMART"" are both my two favorite tours, even though I never got myself to a U2 concert until November 2001 and THAT was a transcendent experience!  Same with ""Vertigo in Nov 2005"", but that show was not to the high standard left by the big stadium tours.These guys still deliver.  Wait and be patient for ""Red Rocks 1983"" too it will come out soon I think!  And when it does, expect the same love and care given out by the men from U2!!!"
326,dvd,"Incredible ! Zoo TV , 12 years on and still holding up strong...IMHO Achtung Baby / Zoo TV was as revolutionary, groundbreaking and mezmerizing to 90s Rock as The Beatle's Sgt. Pepper was in the 60's. Get this DVD. "
327,dvd,"Live from Sydney is the first DVD release to actually take place long before the others. Done around the Achtung Baby/Zooropa era, the DVD is missing a lot of those songs from Pop to All That You Can't Leave Behind and Atomic Bomb. For some it's great (I mean, how often can we see Beautiful Day and Elevation on a DVD?) while others wish that certain songs were included or that the concert took place after a certain record. Zoo TV was just the precursor to the band's too-ambitious PopMart tour yet at the same time it's great to see that spectacle aspect.As usual with a U2 DVD, the set tends to be chockful of whatever album they were promoting. Not that Achtung Baby is a bad album, in fact it's my top U2 album trumping the usual de-facto best album Joshua Tree. Only thing is though is that the set seems to be one Achtung Baby track after another. Great to see Even Better than the Real Thing while I wish Wild Horses was on. However, we get some great moments including a great Unchained Melody rendition, Lemon on DVD finally as well as Love is Blindness. One disappointment is that there's no All I Want is You, Heartland, I Still Haven't Found..., Bad, and damnit, put Gloria for a change on the set.Of course anyone can go through an entire U2 DVD and whine about what they missed or what they haven't written yet such as Discotheque and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me. Where the show does shine though is there's a true grandiose fashion to it all. From car floodlights to a big remote control checking out soccer games to Bono calling for a cab, it's a far cry from the relatively straightforward DVD's of recent. While it is missing a bit of those charismatic moments such as the Boston DVD where he lay beside a girl on the stage or Slane Castle where he was practically in tears during Kite but during Love is Blindness he actually held onto a fan for almost the entire song...in Macphisto makeup.While it doesn't have the power of Boston or intimacy of Slane Castle, it's nonetheless a great portrait of rockers who were very daring and showmen at one point"
328,dvd,"FIRST OFF:""The Man in the Moon"", is a great film! With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot.IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below]Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old. The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?! THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below]Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens.Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man.Robert Mulligan - DirectorSam Waterston  - Matthew Trant Tess Harper  - Abigail Trant Gail Strickland  - Marie Foster Reese Witherspoon  - Dani Trant Jason London  - Court Foster Emily Warfield  - Maureen Trant Bentley Mitchum  - Billy Saunders ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFERSPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER  SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MOREBOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINTThis is quite a little story with a big punch. The supporting roles are impeccably played with Sam Waterston playing Matthew Trant, the father, and Tess Harper playing Abigail Trant, as the mother. They have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in Louisiana."
329,dvd,"I loved the setting of this movie; it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds I enjoy hearing. The pace was relaxed but not dull at all. The plot was sweet, the acting well done. Reese Witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie, her first major role."
330,dvd,"I LOVED this movie. Breathtaking scenery, a simple yet enthralling story, and wonderful acting all around. No drugs, no guns, no over-the-top violence. A nice movie to watch on a rainy day...."
331,dvd,I love this little story of the relationship between two sisters. The performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting. It still gets me :
332,dvd,"I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time.A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message"
333,dvd,"This is a masterpiece of cinema. After watching Robert Mulligan's more famous (to me) movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of '42, I found this jewel. I did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is.Directors like Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch or Vidor and Capra are long gone, and so is cinema as art, but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it, although it may only last a blink of an eye.I am off to check out ""Come September"" now.Who is this Robert Mulligan, anyway?Lovable little gem"
334,dvd,"Excellent movie. Seriously, why can't they make more movies like this? Smart, well-acted, very dramatic, exciting. I could go on and on. Just a very satisfying movie....each of the thousand times I have watched it. If I accidently come across it on TNT or HBO or wherever, I have to sit and watch it until the end even though I have it on DVD right there on my bookshelf! I can't walk away!I love the beginning of the movie when they are boarding the sub, and they are standing in the rain while Hackman addresses the crew, and he has that little Q routine with the chief of the boat (George Dzundza). This scene really sets the tone. It almost made me want to join the Navy. The battle between Hackman and Washington's characters is, of course, what the movie is all about, and they pull it off flawlessly. Very good work by both men. That said, all of the key charactors are interesting and well-acted. The director really pulls this movie together very well despite the many charactors involved (many of these guys are big stars now). The great acting, the very exciting story, and edge of the seat drama just overwhelm whatever weaknesses or improbabilities that may exist in this movie. Great stuff."
335,dvd,"This is a simply amazing movie, and what makes it even more stellar is that we've had several fantastic submarine movies in the past - Das Boot and Red October come to mind. We've already seen the claustrophobic, booming power of being trapped in an underwater submarine. That this movie is able to make that closeness even more powerful - and draw us into a story that really grips you with its meaning - is rather impressive. We begin with two powerhouses of actors, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Gene is in charge of the sub; Denzel works for him. Gene is an unabashed alpha male, not unheard of in a commander. Denzel is intelligent and respects the chain of command. Suddenly, we're thrown into a situation where the sub *might* have been ordered to launch a missile attack on an enemy to protect the US. Unfortunately, the sub can't get confirmation. So either they shoot and risk starting WWIII for no reason - or they fail to shoot and leave millions of people open to slaughter. The plot and dialogue is incredible because it explores all the shades of grey in the characters. There's no right or wrong. Both scenarios are equally plausible. Gene wants to do what he was ordered to do, to save as many lives as he can. Denzel is desperate to get confirmation rather than risk mistakenly starting a world war. Both men suck up the men around them into their sides. Nobody WANTS the war. Gene doesn't take pleasure in firing - but he sees it as a necessary action to save lives. In such close confines, every person on screen makes a huge difference. This movie had not only two stellar top men, but also a fantastic supporting cast. James Gandolfini a la Sopranos. Viggo Mortensen a la Lord of the Rings. The music from Hans Zimmer is just amazing. He is a genius and can give incredibly subtle nuances to his works. If I had to find something to nit-pick in this movie, it's that I don't think the sub scenes were truly ""realistic"". It seemed more of a Hollywood sub than a real working piece of machinery that trained soldiers were living in for months. I think Das Boot did an exquisite job of getting that sense across. But really, the sub in this case was a ""set"" for the dialogue and character development to happen in. It wasn't the showcase, and this wasn't a sub documentary. So I'm willing to accept that tradeoff, so that we could have as tightly woven a story as we got."
336,dvd,"The very best war movies resonate with viewers not just because of top flight acting but because there is always a subtext present that demands that viewers think as well as view.  In CRIMSON TIDE, director Tony Scott allows the events on the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine, to force viewers to confront some truly ugly but inevitable revelations: that in some dicey situations there are no good versus bad guys, just decent men who demand that events follow their own unique perceptions of those events. Gene Hackman is Captain Ramsey, a tough nuclear sub skipper who has just received an order to launch his sub's missles at Russia, which has just discovered that one of its military bases has been taken over by a rogue general who is determined to launch his missles at America.  Just after Ramsey receives his order to launch, the needed verfication to launch does not arrive due to an unexpected underwater confrontation with a Russian sub.  The Alabama's radio is damaged. Should Ramsey launch anyway on the premise that to delay can lead only to the certainty that the Russians will get the first blow in? His XO, Lieutenant Commander Turner (Denzel Washington) does not think so.  Both believe that the other is totally wrong.  Turner leads a mutiny to prevent the launch.CRIMSON TIDE is a claustrophobic testosterone filled plunge into the icy waters of duty versus rationality.  Hackman injects his role with the total believability of ruthlessness that has come to mark his essential film persona.  He can slug Washington in the face in one scene to enforce his decision to launch.  Then in the very next scene can placidly discuss horse breeding with the same man with the same believability. CRIMSON TIDE is a film of men under stress with some handling it better than others.  George Dzundza has a powerful supporting role as the head of security who is forced by circumstances to back Washington, whom he believes to be in the right over Ramsey, a captain whom he greatly respects but believes to be in the wrong.  When Ramsey regains control, Dzundza grudgingly admits, ""Half of me is glad that he did.""  And that right there is the compelling subtext of the movie: that events force both actor and viewer to decide whether unfolding events ought to fill us with fear that one or the other side may be in the Right--but never knowing which is which.  CRIMSON TIDE is a terrific film that requires the viewer to face such a choice whether he wants to or not"
337,dvd,OH YA FORGET NAVY SUBS WELL THE RUSSIAN MILITARY IS BETTER AND RUSSIAN ARMY BETTER THEY CAN BEAT USA
338,dvd," This movie was good, though there were many innacuracies as to what really goes on inside a nuclear sub. That aside it is very good"
339,dvd,"I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW DISC SET COMING OUT. Finally this morning, Disney has delayed the DVD release of the Crimson Tide: Unrated  Extended Edition from 3/14 to 5/16. No word as to why"
340,dvd,"When this movie came out in 1995, I caught it in the theatre and enjoyed it so much, I bought the Video Tape (and just to let you know - The Hunt for Red October, Video Tape, also!).  But I digress.  Gang, it appears that a ""Unrated"" version of ""Crimson Tide"" is coming out on DVD.  ""Unrated??""  What could they possible put on the DVD to make it unrated?  The scheduled release date is 03/14/2006.  IF I can equate ""Unrated Version = Special Edition,""  then I'm in for my copy!  Great movie - Four Stars!!"
341,dvd,"  I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to ""entertain""/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book ""The Gold Crew"" had a more believable plot.  Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers. It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it. From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water"
342,dvd,"Take a solid script about nuclear warfare, puff it up with Quentin Tarantino style, cram it all into a submarine called the U.S.S. Alabama, throw in the legendary Gene Hackman and future legend Denzel Washington and what do you get?  ""Crimson Tide.""One of the best military flicks I've ever seen.  Chock full of emotion, intensity and suspense, ""Crimson Tide"" takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of life, death, and warfare on a nuclear Naval submarine.  Hackman is the captain of the Alabama, a sub destined to launch nuclear missiles on Russia in a last ditch attempt to suppress rebel forces in that country.  Denzel Washington is the handpicked XO that is forced to make a terrible decision.  During an undersea battle with rebel forces, an emergency message is lost during transmission.  Was the message sent to stop plans to fire the nuclear missiles or to go ahead with the plans?  Hackman insists he go ahead with his original orders to launch the nukes.  Washington stands against him and has the captain sent to his quarters.  All of this is done by the book.  What results is a mutiny by the captain in an attempt to regain control of his sub and continue his original mission.Full of intense sequences involving life and death situations, this film left me exhausted by the constant decisions made and the timing of each event.  Hackman and Washington were superb in their roles.  Each conveyed the emotion and allegiance of their respective characters flawlessly.  But the list of excellent actors doesn't stop there.  Viggo Mortensen, of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hidalgo"" fame, plays Webster.  He's Washington's friend and a loyal officer on the ship who literally holds the fate of the world in his hands.  Steve Zahn (""Saving Silverman,"" ""Daddy Daycare,"" ""Happy, Texas"") is solid in a supporting role.  Former child star Rick Schroder also appears in a brief but moving role.  Danny Nucci (""Titanic"") plays an officer who stands for what he believes is right.  James Gandolfini (""The Sopranos"") is also here in a wonderfully sinister role as Hackman's loyal shipmate.  Oh, and don't forget to throw in Ryan Phillipe (""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Cruel Intentions""), who has a miniscule role but does well none the less.  There are other faces in the crowd who haven't achieved as much fame, but you'll recognize them from smaller roles in other films.  For instance, George Dzundza, who's been in a ton of films but never a star and Scott Grimes, who I only knew was in this film when I saw the credits role.  You may recognize Grimes' name from ""Critters.""  In short, this motion picture has a very capable cast of well-known performers, future stars, and minor players who fill out the plot exceptionally well.Highly recommended to fans of claustrophobic cinema such as ""The Hunt For Red October"" and naval stories in general.  Also, fans of intense drama will definitely enjoy this film"
343,dvd,"Three jocular guys get on stage and do a lampoon homage to the classics, while breaking down the fourth wall like a wrecking ball. The Beastie Boys? Nope, it's the Reduced Shakespeare Company. They break character, break the play, argue about the direction of the play (like kids in a pick-up game), toss good-natured insults, and interact with/razz the audience.  They even do a long spoof on pretentious acting workshops, as they prepare a dragged up audience member to say her line (actually, she just has to scream -- but it's a good one with subtext! :-)  Throughout the show, the trio's ""what next"" anarchy is more entertaining than their condensed versions of plays. For Bard vets, this disc may re-contextualize your ideas about the plays. For kids and beginners, it may inspire. (It's obvious that the Reduced players mastered Shakespeare before they broke it down). For people who read prescribed Shakespeare as a chore, with MTV on... and never looked back (like me)... the show's anarchy/""lack of respect"" will entertain. In short, the Reduced posse has something for everyone.  It may even be better than reading Macbeth Cliffs notes with the Beastie Boys cranked up to 11.... Maybe....  ""If you, wanna know, the real deal about the three, well let me tell you we're triple trouble, y'all, we're gonna bring you up to speed -- check it out!"" (Beastie Boys).  Get your learn on"
344,dvd,"There are a few moments in the play that thankfully my younger children didn't seem to get, but I wouldn't have missed their acting it out afterwards for all the money in the world!One reviewer wrote that it helps to have a knowledge of Shakespeare before watching, and I agree to an extent. That does make it funnier when they combine the titles of the comedies,  however I also feel that someone unfamiliar will want to become familiar after watching this group play with the material so easily. Fantastic and refreshing! "
345,dvd,"And yes, while it is helpful to know your Shakespeare (*ahem* Team Francis Bacon), it is not necessary to have more than a passing recollection of the tediousness of it that was foisted off onto you in high school, to find this comedy troupe a laugh riot. With all the $100 million+ budget drivel coming out of Hollywood in the last decade, it was really nice just to be able to sit back and enjoy something chock full of talent and mirth."
346,dvd,"This is a hilarious play, taped for TV viewing. I have seen the original and on second viewing it was equally funny. While it MAY help to know some Shakespeare, there is so much slapstick and other humour that the whole family will laugh"
347,dvd,This is one of the funniest DVDs I have ever seen! You can watch it over and over again and its still just as funny.Definately a must for any video collection
348,dvd,"This show, on stage or on DVD, never ceases to amaze me. I enjoyed watching it and it never gets old. some slight understanding of shakespeare helps to understand the humor, but overall i thought it was awesome. definitely worth the money"
349,dvd,"These guys are terrific! I'm a student of Shakespeare, so every time I read a play I haven't read before I pull out this DVD to see what they've done to it! After reading Coriolanus I was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play wasn't appropriate for children. If you love Shakespeare, or are just curious about Shakespeare, buy this DVD"
350,dvd,Jeeezeee.......... It was a good break from the normal junk that get's put out... These guys are genuinly funny and it shows on stage.... PURCHASE IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH.... You don't even have to understand a word or a line or know anything about Shakespeare to enjoy this!!
351,dvd,"This movie is still as good today as it has always been. I had the original on VHS, but decided to get the DVD because I don't have a video machine any more. The only problem I have is that I was hoping for subtitles because the accent is a bit thick in places and I can't make out what they are saying. I checked the spec and Amazon says the DVD had subtitles. But when I played the movie it said there was were no subtitles. Besides that, no other issues with the DVD."
352,dvd,"Scott Neal and Glen Berry team up in this British film of two gay adolesents coming to terms with their sexuality and the pitfalls it entails. I don't know of a more tender, sweet love story between two young males than ""BEAUTIFUL THING"". The title says it all. In the face of a cruel world, predjudice society, and family struggles, these two lads find something beautiful and unique, through each other, that they never knew could possibly exist. This is the perfect companion video to ""GET REAL"". Very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast. If you like gay romance, and coming of age films, this one will surely go down as one your very favorites of all time"
353,dvd,"I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from ""a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building"" to ""hot and heavy can't live without each other love""?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie"
354,dvd,"I did enjoy this film - it had animated characters - gay sexual tensions - a bit of drama - and a heartwarming ending - 4 stars - You know the story Gay Boy (Jamie) falls for the Hot Boy Next Door (Ste). Is he Gay? Is he Straight? Find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist. Plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath - Jamie makes the first move, a very tense moment in any young mans life!     "
355,dvd,"Movies, plays, and books are all subjective endeavors. The idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece.  In the case of BEAUTIFUL THING, that is not hard  to do.  From the opening frame you want Jamey to thrive. He hates PE because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer (the English call it football). He jumps the fence and heads home skipping PE for the umpteenth time. Who can blame him and when a school chum's, Ste's, homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn, Jamey's mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship.As the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other, the music of Mama Cass Elliott plays in the background. The story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple.  You know they are young but not too young.  You wish that had happened to you when you were their age.Earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story, so I won't go into that here.  Instead, I want you to see the DVD so you can experience the feeling I felt at the end of the movie when Jamey and Ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors.  Unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood, I chose to suspend my disbelief and each time I watch it, I mouth the word ""yes"". "
356,dvd,"I have talked it over with a few of my friends, and I have come to feel that there are certain films that are among the most important in Queer cinema for any generation.  For Gen-X, the film I would have to call THE important Queer cinema film would be Beautiful Thing"
357,dvd,"A wonderful story about you young men that fall in love, once you see it you want to own it, and i did, so i bought it. ive seen it 4 times and will watch it many times more"
358,dvd,"I find this film very interesting, though not for the reasons you would expect. It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah  deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas  Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film"
359,dvd,This is a charming flick about two teenage boys who discover their love for one another after harrowing circumstances land them in the same apartment and eventually in the same bed
360,dvd,"Fortunitely, way back when, I got a hold of a vinyl album that spotlighted various tracks of comedic highlights from this show. Fortunitely this show plays on cable like ""I Love Lucy"". The opening duet and final piano play were both included on the vinyl album in entirety. The show had many moments that could make the most solemn creature belt a good one because the situations were anything but goody-goody. They were newsworthy from pregnancy, abortion, homosexuality, atheism, religion, politics, and of course, bigotry. I read one article, back when the show first premiered, that a woman called her son long distance to make him tune in to ""All In The Family"" so he could see how his deceased father was."
361,dvd,"It's amazing to watch this television series and realize we live in an age where people seem to believe everything goes (like same sex marriages, freedom of just about everything including behavior) yet many of the topics addressed with humor in this show are completely taboo on the regular channels. It was funny during the 70's, and it's still funny today"
362,dvd,"IF A COMPANY WANTS ME TO WRITE A REVIEW IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR SALES, THEY SHOULD PAY ME"
363,dvd,This T.V show rates as one of my favorites of all time. In the genre of comedy it is my favorite show to date. One of the great things about All In The Family was its ability to take the viewer on a slice of life journey through the comedic irony and sometimes painful reality of life. In my humble opinion Carroll O'Conner and Jean Stapleton were and are two of the greatest acting talents ever. This DVD collection is very well done. I highly recommend it to all.
364,dvd,An  excellent  rendition  of  the  show  I  saw  on  television.  I  got  to  see  the  episodes  I  had  missed
365,dvd,"Archie Bunker is the funniest sitcom character in television history. I own all five seasons and am eagerly awaiting the sixth. Of course, like most sitcoms, the humor of the first season does not have quite as much punch as the rest of them. But, I DID about split my side on the very last episode of this season, especially where Archie says...(see review title)"
366,dvd,"As usual, Archie has his crazy ideas of how the world works, the races work, women work, and everything else that he's made up or gathered from his brain or bigoted friends.  I love every minute of it!  I think I enjoy this show because if you look past the obvious, you will learn a lesson.  Episodes like ""Judging Books By Covers"" explains that it's not always the most obvious that are homosexual...and just like anybody else, they are people too, so get over it.  In ""Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood,"" it is more than obvious that Lionel has been coming into Archie's home for years, but suddenly when a black family moves into the neighborhood, Archie realizes that he may have to bend more of his ""rules"".  I am crazy about Lionel's tactics in dealing with Archie...and how Archie can't seem to realize that Lionel is making fun of him ALL THE TIME. ""The First and Last Supper"" was entertaining because this is when George Jefferson gets to show that he is just as bad as Archie by not showing up to dinner.  This was a brave show to put on television, not because it showed a racist view. We have plenty of those type of shows today.  But because ""All in the Family"" makes fun of prejudice, racism, and sexism in a way that no show has done since. "
367,dvd,"'Amazon reviewers' have already pointed out the dramatic change this show brought to sit- com TV. They have also indicated the specific episodes included here. They have said something about Archie and dingbat Edith, Meatball and little sweet Gloria. My only addition is to point out how much pleasure this show brought to my own parents, of blessed memory. It was waited for and anticipated each week."
368,dvd,"Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done.  Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.   Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.   The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.   Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential ""Stonewall"" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.   For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.   It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.   Admirers of ""Stonewall"" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with ""Stonewall"" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.   His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.   It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.  In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb.   I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition.   It was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with Stonewall. "
369,dvd,"An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine.GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could.True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place. The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself.  But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die.Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances.Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain.'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'.The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves.This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest"
370,dvd,"It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.Most of the ""women"" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was ""such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual"" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.  Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.  There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.Gettysburg is much better.  I actually missed Sheen and I hate that guy"
371,dvd,"I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well"
372,dvd,When I got this DVD it was like I was there at the concert. The sound is so good. The band did an excelent job
373,dvd,"REO still rocks and this concert proves that Rock and Roll is still alive with this power performance!  The band still has the youthful hunger of the early years!  Lead Kevin Cronin's voice still sounds great singing favorites like:""Time for me to fly,"" ""Don't let him go,"" ""Take it on the run,"" ""Keep on loving you,"" ""Can't fight this feeling anymore,"" ""and so many others!! I love the lead guitar in REO Dave Amato!! Awesome lead guitar gives REO a great edge! I've seen REO this summer in concert recently and saw how the audience, including me, just gravitated to the front of the stage and rocked the night away!  We all knew the songs and the place became a communal atmosphere that just doesn't happen anymore with music. Luckily I happened to reach up and catch one of Kevin Cronin's guitar picks which now has a framed presentation in my bedroom. It was fun!  REO has brought back a better time for music and with this concert dvd, I can relive it over and over.  Don't forget the special features which are interviews with Kevin Cronin and Neal Doughty. Love it and you will too"
374,dvd,"If you are from that Deep Purple ,Foreigner ,Rainbow ,Whitesnake,Bad Company... era,just go ahead and grab this one .Good Sound ,Picture and The band sounds really tight"
375,dvd,"""Plus"" was brilliantly shot before an packed enthusiastic crowd in Kansas City, and shows the 5 guys of the current REO and how awesome performance musicians they are. Contains the same show on the Arch Allies CD with Styx, but this is REO on their own and That Ain't Love, Keep Pushin, and Tough Guys were added. They can't stop rockin, in fact they sound tighter live than many bands sound in the studio. It also contains interviews with Kevin and Neal (on the DVD they are separate from the performance), and the DVD also contains 5.1 Dolby sound, and a trivia game fun and challenging for even longtime fans. Highly recommended whether or not you've worn out your copy of the Wheels are Tourin video :-"
376,dvd,A great film with an engrossing story- I literally could not take my eyes off it.George Peppard's signature role (better than Tiffany's). If you long for a movie with a great story buy it! Congrats to Paramount for the excellent transfer- sharp with great colours and very little evidence of print damage
377,dvd,"I've been a fan of this version of the movie for years. I love the theme music, and the storyline. George Pappard is wonderful also. Definitely dated, a lot of sexist stuff, pre women's lib"
378,dvd,"I'm a huge fan of the harold robbins novel but i've got to say that the film is every bit as good and probably better. The only thing lacking id the back story about nevada smith but he has his own film as well so i recommend getting that one also. overall its a terrific story and in a day and age when its all about special effects this film stands alone as a story, and a bloody good one at that"
379,dvd,"""The Carpetbaggers"" is a fantastic adaptation of Harold Robbins' bestseller, very racy for its era, with dialogue that is often rare and juicy, a superb cast, and great direction by Edward Dmyrtryk. The character of Jonas Cord is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, and it is interesting to compare this film with Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator."" Both George Peppard as Cord and Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes give brilliant performances, but overall, I find this film far more satisfying, and certainly a lot more entertaining. Peppard was at the height of his career in this film, and it is perhaps his best. It gives him a wide range of emotions, as well as the physicality and toughness he was so good at. Others that shine in the large cast are Alan Ladd in what was to be his last film as Nevada Smith, Carroll Baker as the sultry Rina, Robert Cummings as Nevada's slick and slimey manager. Elizabeth Ashely as Mrs. Jonas Cord (and who soon after this film was to become the real life Mrs. Peppard), Martin Balsam as the owner of a film studio, and Lew Ayres, as second in command in Jonas Cord's empire, has some of the best lines in the film.The pacing of the film never lags, and there is a brutal fight between Jonas and Nevada, one of those screen fights that is always fascinating to watch. The Nevada Smith character is quite complex, and was to spawn a ""prequel"" 2 years later, starring Steve McQueen. The cinematography by Joseph MacDonald is marvelous, the Edith Head gowns lavishly glamorous, and very important to the success of this film is the fabulous jazzy score, which is one of Elmer Bernstein's finest. In my youth I devoured all of Robbins' books, loved the well-written sleaze of them, and loved this film in its theatrical release. I've since watched it repeatedly, and find more to enjoy in it with each viewing. Total running time is 150 minutes. "
380,dvd,"I just got through watching this Dmytryk film on TCM tonight, and all I can say is that if you are looking for the George Peppard who played Paul Varjak in Breakfast at Tiffany's, forget it.  In fact, he is so cold and so stiff (I realize he's trying to play a nasty Howard Hughes knockoff), that a cardboard figurine would have been just as convincing in his stead.Outside of great costumes and sets, this movie is long and boring.  Where it's not boring it's a snicker inducing raunchfest.  Poor Alan Ladd in his final role, barely having to act as he plays a drunken hasbeen, and Elizabeth Ashley who is the only redeeming character in the entire plot and also resembles Audrey Hepburn to a scary degree in the last half of this debacle.  Carroll Baker may be sexy in her lingerie, but she's so over-the-top with her heavy breathing and her lingerie that you actually want to cheer when her car goes off the road.I can think of better ways to pass my time for 2 and 1/2 hours than this...like watching the mating rituals of moth-eaten underwear.  Still, you just can't stop watching it through to its unrealistic ending.  If I'd have thought beating up one of my old flames after years of his acting like a total jag would have changed him overnight, I'd have done it long ago!  If you must see this lousy piece of 60's smut, make sure you rent it or come across it on TV before you go buying it.  I've seen corpses that are more convincing than Peppard was in this flick!        "
381,dvd,"This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish.  It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp.  Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot.  George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on ""The A-Team"".  Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture.  It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill.  Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy.  The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular).  If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow"
382,dvd,"I just finished watching the ""The Carpetbaggers"" on AMC; I thought the 'C' part of that acronym was ""Classic"", but now realize that perhaps 'Cornball,' 'Contagious,' or 'Compelling' may substitute since this movie seemed to be all of this.  But, hey, maybe that's just the gin talkin.  It is one of those movies that you cannot wait to end, so you can find out just who these B-film actresses really were - yet you continue to watch.  But when it does end, you are somewhat saddened that it is over.  Partially sad because you have been drawn in by this charismatic yet utterly ruthless SOB Jason Cord (George Peppard), but mostly just sad because AMC DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE CREDITS! that's why I'm here...finding out that the actresses were Caroll baker (as Rina Marlowe, the not-so-lovable Hollywood star; and Elizabeth Ashley (as Monica Cord) - the impossibly forgiving ex/not-so-happily-ever-after-wife of the unmarriable-unlovable-unrelenting-insanely ambitious Jason.  Bob Cummings gets accolades as the fiendishly charming scumbag who plays Dan Pierce - most probably a very typical Hollywood agent.  Someone who would put a rattlesnake in your pocket and then ask you for a match if he could get 10% of your blood in doing so.  Go ahead and watch the dern thing (4/5 stars) - You'll understand.  But hey - don't forgit the gin"
383,dvd,"Brandenburg, a world famous photographer, sets out on a personal mission with his thinking and experience beautifully described in this stunning DVD.

384,dvd,Photographer Jim Brandenburg takes you on his personal photographic journey that re-awakened his spirit and love of his craft after a burn out shooting for National Geographic magazine.

385,dvd,"...how dumb movies can get. Then again, maybe I was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film. Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life. Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from? Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness. Not recommende"
386,dvd,"Surviving 40 Days and Nights without Sex        In the film 40 Days and 40 Nights, no sex is Kryptonite to Josh Hartnett's character, Matt because he cannot go through a day without thinking of sex and it ruins his social life by not being able to talk to girls without having sex on his mind. He strongly wants to follow through with his promise to himself by staying pure for the entire 40 days and nights.	This film is perfectly made for Josh Hartnett for being such a teenage heartthrob. It's a wonderful comedy full of hilarity and sexy jokes. There are all kinds of things to laugh at such as the bagel guy to the crazy roommate.  Many of the characters in the movie are funny and don't make Matt have such an easy time with the whole 40 days and 40 nights. It's not something that he is capable of doing and they all have faith that he will fail.	         Matt being a raging sexaholic is a very strong character who attempts to not have sex for lent. Meaning for an entire 40 days and 40 nights he has to sacrifice what he enjoys most. Each day matt tries to do something constructive that helps him no think about sex, such as model car building and doing laundry. In the work place, Matt's co-workers start a bet to see which day he will break. It later turned into an online betting all over the internet. Prior to all of this he's been on a sex binge because of his girlfriend left him to dry. It's been the only thing that he knows and helps cope with the pain he's suffering.  Matt starts to go through sex withdraw and everything he sees turns into some sexy act in his mind.        He then meets a girl while doing this laundry one day. Easily there's an attraction but knowing that he cannot have contact with any female physically, he keeps to himself and doesn't say a word to her. As time goes on Matt starts to talk to her and makes a date with her. The date goes wonderful but instilled in his mind is that he can't have any sexual acts with this woman. She finds this weird and at her work place she came upon the website with the online bets. This made things very difficult for him and her. She starts to lose interest in him when he tells her the truth about what he can't do. This is the first time he's felt this way for a woman other than his ex-girlfriend. He truly falls for her and this time he didn't have to have sex. In his mind he wants to get her back so bad but he has that promise to himself that he feels is more important. Now the movie becomes the typical love story where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, then boy will get her back.	In anybody's point of view 40 Days and nights is torture to a character like Matt. Since he's such a lady's man and is extremely sex dependent. Many people know that 40 days isn't that much but to him it feels like an eternity."
387,dvd,"Anyone who thoroughly enjoyed movies such as The Sweetest Thing, 10 Things I Hate About You and Sweet Home Alabama will love this movie.  Josh Hartnett's sweet nature in this movie is very cute.  Josh Hartnett fans everywhere should flock to this movie"
388,dvd,"I bought the set and was very surprised to find that the episodes were much better than I remember them.  I have to admit that they do not compare with the early All in the Family episodes, but neither do the later All in the Family episodes.  But none the less, I am glad they are on DVD and am glad that I purchased them.  Does anyone know if the second season will be available soon"

390,dvd,"I own every ""All In The Family"" season box set out on the market and started collecting the ""Archie Bunker's Place"" season box sets.  Can someone please explain to me why we still get edited versions??? I thought the idea behind dvd is that we are supposed to get commercial free and unedited versions.  To my knowledge, even All in the Family has a few edited episodes.  Why are they doing this?  It is frustrating"
391,dvd,"""Archie Bunker's Place"" was a wonderful sequel to the infamously wonderful sitcom 'All in the Family'. Winnipeg Manitoba was wondering about the picture of Beverly LaSalle on the back cover.  You're right, the character of Beverly LaSalle died on All in the Family.  It was a poignant 2-part episode during season 8 which was called, 'Edith's Crisis of Faith'.Shows like these will go down in the chronicles of television history and thanks to the studio companies for releasing these timepieces on DVD so the world can keep the memory of 'good television' alive today."
392,dvd,"Archie Bunker's Place is not All in the Family, but very few sitcoms are. If you give Archie's Bunker's Place a chance you will learn it is better then most highest rated sitcoms on the Air Today in 2006. This DVD set is very good with mostly uncut Episodes as they have not been seen since they aired on CBS. Archie New Partner Part 1 seems to be the same syndicated edited version that I recorded off WPSG  CH 57in Philadelphia back in 1998 with Archie's great line to Harry about If Old McDonald had he not expanded farm into a fast food chain and that Cornel Sanders still would have been a private in the Army straggling chickens had he not taken a chance on his chicken joints were not included (These lines were kept in the TVLand edit in 2002). Other then that the rest of the episodes seems to be intact.  Great liner notes Inside the DVD with episode credits"
393,dvd,"   I have always enjoyed All In The Family and consider it one of the best TV shows ever,in any genre.This series covers the ""continuing adventures of Archie Bunker"".It is definitely not as good as AITF but it is a logical extention of that series,especially in light of the fact that Rob Reiner,Sally Struthers and Jean Stapleton wanted to move on to other things and only Archie would remain (Stapleton was in ABP season 1 but was phasing out of the role).   I never saw either series in their original run (too young),but I've seen AITF many,many times in reruns and on DVD.I hadn't seen ABP since it was rerun on WLVI Channel 56 in Boston many years ago,and it is great to see it again.My girlfriend had never seen it and is a big Archie fan,and she was thrilled to get it on the day of its release.   Don't expect to see AITF,but if you are a fan of Archie Bunker you will enjoy this series.The fact that All In The Family ended,the whole cast but Archie basically changed,the show became a spin-off continuation,and it ran for 4 top 20 seasons tells you how powerful a character Archie was.It was still in the Top 20 when CBS pulled the plug.It seems that Archie could not be stopped"
394,dvd,"I'm not sure why Sony Home Entertainment decided to start releasing ""Archie Bunker's Place"" on DVD before ""All in the Family"" was finished, nor do I know why they picked such a goofy-looking picture of Archie to put on the cover (What's up with that grin?  He looks like a doofus!).  However, I will still be purchasing this box set to go along with the AITF sets.  Even though it's not as good as the original series, it's still worthy to own, especially when the episodes are the original uncut versions.  As usual, Amazon is the best place to buy it from since it's cheaper than the brick and mortar stores and there's free shipping to boot!  Buying this release will only serve to give the publisher more faith in anything with Archie Bunker, so the rest of the AITF seasons might not be too far behind.  So, here's a good place to cast your vote for it!  You'll enjoy this set for sure"
395,dvd,"Archie Bunker is now the owner of Kelsey's Bar. In this new spin-off he changes the name of the bar, but Kelsey was the previous owner. The bar plays a major role because the title of the sitcom Archie Bunker's Place is describing the bar. On a later episode of All in the family we hear Edith say that Kelsey was Irish, so the bar was Irish. Even on the front of this DVD we see the bar in the background. This could account for the Shamrock on the cover. Its still a good spin-off but doesn't have the charm the original had"
396,dvd,"Quite coincidentally, this movie was on television last night, right after I broke up with my boyfriend and he left.  We broke up because he doesn't want to leave his 25 year marriage where there are now adult children, only to enter into my family (consisting of my little boy and me), and take on head of household, parental responsibilities again.  While I was single a long time until I married (at the age of 38) he never had prolonged single time where he could be mostly self-centered.  He wants that time now.  So he left.Unlike this movie, he doesn't walk the streets like Billy Crystal, thinking how great it is to be alone and, allegedly, a free spirit, only to ""see the light"" and come racing to his girlfriend to tell he that he loves her, and ""when you love somebody, you want your relationship to start right now""! No, in my case, he left and he hasn't called (even though I asked him not to), and I'm fairly certain he is not coming back.  Very sad.But a great movie"
397,dvd,"""When Harry Met Sally"" is one of my favorite films.  It's one of those movies you can watch again and again, and never get sick of it.  Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are hilarious, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are excellent in their supporting roles.  I can't recommend this movie enough. "
398,dvd,"I just finished watching When Harry Met Sally for probably the tenth time.  It's been years since I've seen it and I enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend.  I couldn't get over the fact that I still laughed several times, almost as if I'd never seen the movie before.My interpretation, after all these years, was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments, infatuation, etc. without stooping to sugary sentiment.  I took Harry and Sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable.  I didn't see them as somehow representative of ""all men"" or ""all women.""Then I watched the extra documentary on the DVD which I had never seen until now.  Big mistake.  My new ""interpretation"" of the film was suddenly cast aside as I remembered that I actually didn't like this movie as much when it first came out.  Over time I had grown to accept the fact that I could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved.  What I had forgotten was Billy Crystal's, Rob Reiner's (director) and Nora Ephron's (writer) agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders.  Gag.The views of the characters are presented as if they were fact.  Men supposedly always think about sex and can't be friends with women.  Most if not all women have faked an orgasm.  All men are clueless to the fakery.  And so on.I can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the Boomer generation and older folks (no one on this film is even close being a member of Gen X) because this does not represent the reality of all humans.  You'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to ""prove"" their case.  If they'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it - ""No, I won't fake it.  If he sucks in bed I'm going to tell him."" And as for men, some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it.None of this changes this classic film.  That's the great thing about art - it's open to interpretation.  I can watch this film and define it my way - two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love. Otherwise, I'd hate this movie.  But I won't give Reinder, Ephron et al that much power.  Just because they were narrow minded about gender roles doesn't mean I have to be about their film.If you agree with the characters in the film, by all means, watch the documentary.  But if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters, pass it by.  Don't let a DVD extra taint your pov"
399,dvd,"For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake ""O"" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable. One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with. Just FYI.  "
400,dvd,"Can men and women truely just be friends without sex getting in the way? That's the question the movie, 'When Harry Met Sally', asks and tries it's best to answer. This is the story of two characters that meet during a long drive to New York from the University Of Chicago. At first they can't stand each other, but they keep running into each other after years of never talking. They eventually become best friends and the previous question is put into play.I really like this movie. This is what a lot of people would call a ""chick flick"", but it's a movie that guys can get into as well. Billy Crystal plays the male lead and is great in the role. He is funny, as always, and this was the first movie I had seen him in. And what can you say about Meg Ryan that hasn't been said already? Wow. Everybody loves Meg Ryan. Guys think she is beautiful and retains that 'girl next door' quality at the same time. Women just love her movies, think she's a great actress, and find her 'cute'. This was the first of her many romantic roles that would go on to define her career. I honestly couldn't think of a better actress to play this role and she does it flawlessly.Carrie Fisher  Bruno Kirby play key supporting roles here. Fisher is particularly good as Meg Ryan's best friend. Rob Reiner does another great job directing here and was really on a roll by the time this movie came out. Nora Ephron, who would later go on to direct her own 'chick flicks', wrote a great script that was basically based off of a lot of real life influences (including Reiner's divorce).Simply put, this is a great movie to sit and watch with your girlfriend. It's one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. Billy Crystal  Meg Ryan have great chemistry and really own this movie. It's a very funny movie and it goes to show just how different men  women really are.Special Features: There is a 35 min. documentary on the making of the movie. The movie was released in 1989, so having a documentary looking back at the movie was great. Rob Reiner, Nora Ephron,  Billy Crystal do most of the talking here. Carrie Fisher has some moments. Meg Ryan doesn't appear except for old footage from '88. Overall it's a pretty good documentary and surprisingly informative.There are also seven deleted scenes included. They are all pretty good and could have been included in the movie. You also get a music video by Harry Connick Jr. (he did the music for the movie), trailer, and an audio commentary from Rob Reiner. Not a bad collection for a genre of movie ('Romantic Comedy') that rarely gets special addition treatment"
401,dvd,"This movie is on my top 5 list.  Harry Burns' theory that men and women can never be friends because the sex always gets it the way is dead nuts accurate.  Sally tries to rebut this with a hypothetical...what if the girl is unattractive?  Then can you be friends?  To which Harry, in the spirit of all men, replies ""No, you pretty much want to nail them too.""  Finally, a romantic comedy with some undertones that men can appreciate.  Great movie"
402,dvd,"In 1989, a good friend told me this film was excellent. I don't know why, but it took me 17 years to act on his good advice. In a way, I'm glad. Back then I might have simply liked the film. I'm not sure I would have recognized it for the evergreen, fresh and relevant classic that it is. Now, after one viewing, I can and do.Following their graduation from University of Chicago in 1977, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) is kissing his college sweetheart Amanda goodbye when Sally Allbright (Meg Ryan) pulls up in her station wagon to pick him up for the 18-hour shared drive they have arranged back to New York. On the drive, Harry tells an incredulous Sally that men and women can't be friends. Men always want to sleep with women, he says, noting that she is very attractive. When she finally drops him off at Washington Square Park at the foot of Fifth Avenue, Sally tells him to have a good life.They meet again five years later, in an airport, where Sally as Sally, now a journalist, kisses Joe goodbye. Harry, who is traveling on the same plane with Sally, is acquainted with Joe. He's a political consultant, and newly engaged to Helen. Once again, their personalities seem to clash. Another five years pass before Harry again spies Ally, this time in a bookstore with her friend Marie (Carry Fisher). Now, Harry is in the midst of a divorce, while Sally has split up with Joe. Over the next two years, they become the thing that Harry said men and women could never be--just friends. They try dating other people. They even try fixing one another up with their respective best friends, which brings the friends together as a couple, and leaves Harry and Sally still, just friends.Director Rob Reiner and writer Nora Ephron created a comic masterpiece in this film, but they could not have done it without the stellar performances from Crystal, Ryan, Fisher and Bruno Kirby, who plays Harry's friend, Jess.It's not only worth waiting for good things. Sometimes it's really nice, too.--Alyssa A. Lappe"
403,dvd,"Watching Rob Reiners movies is almost always a great pleasure. He just gets to the point, without overkilling. He hits the nerve softly. He has the touch of telling the perfect joke. He tells stories that make you believe that you are in them. A true master in his craft. When Harry Met Sally is definitely one of his best. It's a film that does not get older. It stays fresh. It's a classic. Something that has to be seen, over and over again.J.J.Hartin"
404,dvd,I just rewatched this film and am amazed at how timeless it is - except for the clothing - of course ;)  This film makes you laugh and shows the great dance of romance of a couple trying to find that ever elusive perfect timing.  Another great film for girls' night :
405,dvd,"I love this movie, it is a cute movie, easy to watch, makes you smile alot. I think its a girl movie"
406,dvd,"It's symptomatic of middle-age, I suppose, to reflect warmly on ""the good old days"", and even though I never wanted to fall into that syndrome, seeing ""Help"" has done exactly that for me. I was a Freshman in college when the movie was released, and so it was a movie for the millions of Boomers like me, in that bizarre, wonderful time that was the mid-1960's in America. Others have already written far more insightfully and fully than I intend to here. Simply -- if you like the Beatles, their witty, irreverent, and intellectual sense of humor, their music, and the whole 60's ""British Invasion"" period, you will surely enjoy this comedy. It was one last cheerful, happy, ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60's before the somber, discouraging misery of Vietnam settled in for a long, long time. It could be argued that, in a sense, my generation lost its sense of humor after ""Help"".... If a movie like ""Help"" were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed, unless it were positioned as some kind of Austin Powers spinoff and ""spoof"" (how sick I've become of that word) of the ""Hippie"" period. Would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful, joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other Richard Lester movies, like ""The Three Musketeers"", ""A Hard Day's Night"", and Franco Zefferelli's ""The Taming of the Shrew""? You make your own call... my generation lived it.  Isn't it a pity that you can't buy ""Help"" new anymore? Isn't it interesting that the company that produced ""Help"" on DVD is MPI -- which is the same company that, despite overpowering demand, somehow cannot find it possible to release an even more popular, Academy Award-winning movie from the mid-Sixties -- ""Becket""? Isn't it a pity that you can't buy both ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" as a set? Isn't it a pity that no one makes movies like ""Help"" anymore"
407,dvd,"This was the best movie that the beatles did it was funny and had a bit more of a plot this time. 'in the weeks that followed five more attemts were made to steal the ring.' Quite frankly my favorite attemt was number four he,he. But in 'another girl' we can only wish that Paul would wear that tshirt more often. and my stepsister finally realized that there are more rasons to like the beatles than their music. That is before John turned into mountain man\amish terrorist anyway.Okay! Now I'll actullay reveiw the movie.Help! was a clever movie, and had a plot! Imagine that! Anyway, the movie was about Ringo comming into possesion of a sacred ring. that wont come off. Sooo, Ringo must be sacrificed. So high preist Clang, and Aimee end up trying to sacrifice him. Or Clang is anyway. Aimee's trying to protect him. Prof. Foot and his assistant Algenon are after the ring too. so the beatles end up getting chased everywhere. The bahamas, the alps you know. Well i'm not gonna give away the ending so you'll just have to buy the movie and find out. So do it! it's worth it!"
408,dvd,"Though not the landmark that ""A Hard Day's Night"" was, this film is still a lot of fun, and for current and future generations shows how the Beatles looked and behaved in 1965, in full color (in fact, the color cinematography is striking throughout--should have been nominated for an Oscar).But rather than write a regular review, this is a plea to restore the film and present it in a special edition. The laserdisc from Criterion had many more features than the now out of print DVD release, including photographs that thoroughly detail a lost, deleted scene early in the film with comedian Frankie Howerd--and this scene set up a later scene, which doesn't make as much sense until you understand the context from the deleted scene...The later scene is the one at Scotland Yard where Klang calls Superintendent Gluck's office.  As soon as the Beatles hear the music coming over the phone they plug their ears (""It's them!""), and the inspector goes into a trance. The question is, how did the Beatles know the music came from Klang, and to plug their ears? The answer was revealed in the deleted scene. Briefly, the Beatles visit a guru played by Howerd, where Klang and his henchmen appear and use the music to put the Beatles into a trance (with Ringo incapacitated, Klang was going to cut off the drummer's finger, but is foiled by George, who for the sake of the plot was conveniently wearing earplugs and impervious to the music's hypnotic effects). Having once been exposed to the music, they knew to plug their ears in the scene at Scotland Yard. (BTW, two pictures of the deleted scene are at the film's photo section at imdb.com, and unless it has since been corrected Howerd is incorrectly identified as Brian Epstein in the photos' caption.)Perhaps the scene has been found since the Criterion laserdisc was released, and if so it would be a very special feature. But footage aside, for me the ideal special edition DVD would have two soundtracks, with the original mono soundtrack and mixes of the songs, as well as the later stereo mixes. The original soundtrack may have also contained Foley effects over the songs(i.e. sounds outside of the dialog, like footsteps and the such--perhaps even the sound of the darts hitting the screen in the opening number?) that was eradicated when the distributors replaced the mono songs with those in stereo.Finally the restored version would have the most glaring omission from all the DVD releases--the original aspect ratio. I recall reading quotes from the distributors of the previous releases defending the release of ""Help!"" in a full screen, stating that it wasn't a widescreen movie to begin with. OK, it wasn't ""El Cid"", but then again it wasn't as squarish as the TV screen, and viewing the previous releases you can obviously see that there is more than what is viewed full screen. There was no reason not to release it widescreen and this version MUST have that restored. (It's still amazes me that the Criterion LD was also fullscreen considering presenting discs widescreen was one of their big selling points at the time.)I hope this doesn't get too buried under all the other reviews--in fact I hope that someone inflential sees this and takes action. Otherwise I hope someone somewhere in the Beatles' org is thinking about this and it actually happens--provided the original elements, like the mono soundtrack, aren't altogether lost."
409,dvd,"I first saw Help! when I was in middle school, rifling through my parents' VHS collection.  My friends and I were won over by this silly comedy and the Fab Four, and I have treasured the movie ever since.  It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy.The plot is pure genius in its simplicity:  a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger.  A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice.  A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger.  The Beatles are absolutely clueless.  So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious.The DVD I bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in French.  So once you've seen Help! enough times to know every line by heart, try it out in a foreign language, and laugh even harder at The Beatles speaking in French.Go... to... THE WINDOW... GO... TO... the window.."
410,dvd,"The Beatles accomplished so much - good at music , good at recording and capturing their magic , good at transferring their personalities and appeal onto film . HELP ! is meant to be fun and it has some slapstick elements mostly due to Ringo's abilities as a straight man .He was always the most honest one and he holds the film together . If anyone feels he didn't do as much as the others , then this film is the evidence to the contrary .  The Beatles' humour style incorporates elements of the Goons and Peter Sellers , who was a friend of theirs .Enjoy this silly film and marvel at the best of the songs in it ."
411,dvd,"HELP hit theater screens in 1965 in glorious color -- or colour, if you prefer.  The previous year's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT had budget constraints that restricted it, among other things, to black and white.  With the runaway success of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, the ante was upped considerably to provide HELP with color negative, numerous location shoots, fabulous sets, and (what we could call today) superb music videos.Richard Lester again took the directorial helm of this second Beatles movie.  Richard Lester films have traditionally been off beat comedies and HELP is no exception.  Unlike HARD DAY'S NIGHT, where the screenplay called for the Beatles to act through an exaggerated simulated -- and believable -- day in their lives, HELP had a cloak and daggar plot.  We find religious zealots from the mystic east chasing Ringo across southern England, Switzerland, and the Bahamas to recover a sacred sacrificial ring.  The incompetence of the pursuers is barely exceeded by the Beatles protectors: Scotland Yard.Okay, so there is not much plot here.  HELP is basically a fun filled romp with the Beatles with some great music included.  In fact, the budget was so generous that film locations were chosen almost arbitrarily to provide the Beatles with mini vacations.The Beatles, of course, play themselves.  Veteran actor Leo McKern is the chief villian.  Victor Spinetti, who entertained us as the television producer in HARD DAY'S NIGHT, returns as the mad scientist.  Lovable Roy Kinnear (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Three Musketeers) is the professor's assistant.  Eleanor Bron (A Little Princess) and Patrick Cargill (Around the World in Eighty Days) also costar.HELP has been re-released twice since the 1980s.  The only drawback to this film is that the original movie soundtrack was ""improved.""  In the original print, which occasionally shows up on AMC, the original music soundtrack, complete with background sound effects, is still present.  The new DVD release uses digitally remastered music that can be found on the CD soundtrack.  Unfortunately, not all of these versions are the same tracks from the original movie.  For example, the title song, HELP, is the version from the American Capitol LP.  The original film used the single version. The original track, which can be found on old Capitol/Apple 45 rpm singles -- as well as on the Beatles Rarities album -- is slightly faster and has a heavier vocal emphasis on the word ""Help.""  Other songs are missing subtle background sound effects as they were blotted out by the redubbing of the music tracks.The DVD has a few special features including the movie trailer. It is too bad that the original black and white promotional film for the song HELP, that we see during the opening credits, (albeit without darts hitting the screen) is not included on the DVD.  Still, the DVD is a marked improvement over the last 20 years worth of VHS releases.  In my younger years I enjoyed HELP much more than A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  Now I am not so sure.  They are two very diverse films.  I give five stars to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT for originality and four stars to HELP for color and music"
412,dvd,"if you remember the 60s and the james bond era,then this movie needs no introduction to you..its simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes.for newer viewers,it may seem confusing.the beatles were at thier peak when they did this movie.they were the biggest thing in music no matter what anyone says.and they knew it.that comes accross to some viewers as they ""just did whatever they wanted""and they certaintly did!the james bond connection will come once the newer/younger fan sees goldfinger or thunderball...the beatles themselves called this movie as it was..and excuse to enjoy anyplace or any plot they wanted.a must own no matter who you are..as long as you like the beatles.be open and enjoy"
413,dvd,"It is a pleasure to watch The Beatle's film ""Help."" It's easy listening, lighthearted  and a nice ""snapshot"" in time when they were all enjoying being at the top of their game! All the songs featured were big hits and are well woven into the framework of the movie. Nevertheless, to have another opportunity to experience the dry subtle humor of John Lennon is worth the purchase on it's own! But to know that this was one of the first exposures of Indian music for George Harrison, and to witness this milestone that influenced the rest of his musical and spiritual life, is an extremely rare treat indeed. Ringo Starr continues to entertain with his own brand of whimsical laconicism that remains unequaled and Paul McCartney is very warmly enjoyable in his portrayal of a love-struck member of the band with the lovely leading High Priestess. A must see for new and renewed fans alike"
414,dvd,my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl's moving castle. it has the same kind of story and if you like howï¿½'s moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too
415,dvd,"My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital.  The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum.  Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind.  This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required.  My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2. (Causing them to buy a number of other Ghibli films)Highly recommended"
416,dvd,"Family movies don't get much better than this.  No double-entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable.  Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch.  There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good ""friendly spirit"" movie.Kids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie.  Adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with (and get a chuckle out of) several conversations between parents and their children.This is one of those movies from which you will get the ""warm fuzzies.""  Share it with others in your family"
417,dvd,"A good animated film, with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations.  It also protrays children's ready acceptance of unusual or supernatural.  The father's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming"
418,dvd,My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she's only one year old.  Not to mention that my husband and I saw the movie first and decided we had to buy it for her. We have watched and enjoyed it many times.
419,dvd,"The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off! I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please!"
420,dvd,"My wife,  4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me. He said it was a great family movie. It didn't sound that interesting so I didn't purchase it right away. Finally, one day when I saw a link about it on Amazon, I decided to go for it. We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it. We have since collected 5 of Miazaki, and Studio Ghibli's films, and we plan to purchase more in the future. BTW, if  you like this, also check out ""Wisper of the Heart"", another great Studio Ghibli film. Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie"
421,dvd,"This is an excellent movie for all ages! Get it now.Experience the magic. Wonderful story, acting, and attitude sets this movie from all others"
422,dvd,My Neighbor Totoro is a simply wonderful story.  It portrays innocence and family love at its best and is very delightful to watch.  
423,dvd,"The story was both simple and unencumbered yet soulful and sweet.  The movie has pleasant and beautiful animation (bright colors, soft lines).  The characters (and their offscreen personalities) all are present and make for a fine children's film that both children will enjoy and parents can endure (I had to sit through Pokemon movies - most of them too, yuck!).  For me, the best part of the film was the soundtrack.  Jack Johnson's tuneful songs with catchy lyrics made the film very special.  The soundtrack quickly became one of my favorite CDs.  A must see film for small children.  This film is destined to be a classic and reminded me why I loved the Curious George books when I was a child myself"
424,dvd,"Curious George is fantastic.  Although many people might think that this movie is only made for children, adults will get a kick out of this movie as well.  The music that accompanies the film is great.  It is a warm story that allows you to escape from adult life drudgery and remember what it is to explore and be curious about the world. "
425,dvd,"I didn't grow up reading Curious George books as I was little. So this movie was my first exposure to the character, and now I know everyone in my family will be reading (and watching) George for a very long time. The story was cute and touching, yet at the same time it was fun and engaging.The animation was simple but very tasteful, giving the characters a special ""glow"" that made them stand out and offering numerous shots using angles that are not too usual in animated features (I particularly remember the one of George running on top of buildings trying to catch Ted -the yellow hat man- where the shot is shown from above, as if there were a flying camera focusing on George).In the end, you feel great when the movie is over and, to keep you entertained longer, there's lots of fun extra features to even teach you how to draw George. So whether you are a parent, a kid or simply an admirer of nice animated stories, Curious George is a winner for all"
426,dvd,"*Curious George* was a cute movie.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  It was a simple storyline with George, along with his curiosity, getting himself and the man in the yellow hat in trouble.  Anyways, I had a couple of good laughs.Even though this movie was geared towards kids, you could pick up a couple of lines that were meant for adults.  It was a bit puzzling to see Ted (the man in the yellow hat) as a goofball.  Nonetheless, it worked well into the movie....and George named after George Washington?!?!?  Anyways, like I said, cute movie that anyone will enjoy."
427,dvd,"My four year old loved this movie. The plot was very simple and easy to follow, nothing too complicated for her. The animation was also great for the movie's target audience, very soft and warm. It's a good-hearted little film and George is such a sweet, funny and cute little guy throughout. It was light on plot, probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six, but such a cute movie that I didn't get bored watchingn it with her. This is a great movie for young children"
428,dvd,"This a very well done remake of a children book.  It kept thing simple with the basic idea of George being curious (running into trouble/ adventure) in search for the Man in the Yellow Hat.  I never felt the storyline or voice-acting were every over the top like the Cat in the Hat.  Not as fanatic as CG and other animations coming out this days.  I would recommend this as a solid family movie.DVD problem:There is some issue with this movie on older DVD set in which it does not play or freeze/ skip.  This is very annoying base on a new type of encoding.Why did I watched a children movie, just curious how George has grown?   Curious George doesn't talk if you were wondering, but the Man in the Yellow Hat does."
429,dvd,"Well, I rented this movie for my seven year old step-daughter because I grew up on Curious George and wanted to share that adventure with her. As well, she only speaks spanish and this movie has a spanish language track. I watched the movie before her to hear it in english. I tell you, I was swept in from the DVD menu. This is an absolutely adorable movie, from the animation, the voices of Wil Ferrel and others, to the music, to the way too cute Curious George, to the wonderful feel of the story. There are even some nice lessons about honesty and love. Personally, I loved this movie, and I'm 40 years old. The spanish voice overs were very well done as well, and my daughter also loved the movie, although I laughed out loud more often than her. I'll be waiting for the sequel."
430,dvd,"I couldn't get into this movie. It was boring, too long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. George was annoying and he should've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo. The only thing I liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning"
431,dvd,"Well loved children's character Curious George is now on DVD in a brand new feature length adventure. Curious George the animated feature includes the voice talent of Drew Barrymore and Will Ferrell. Kids won't really care who lends voice talent to this gem.As the film begins, Ted, the Man in the Yellow hat is seen working a museum when the museum is suddenly in a financial crisis. To save the museum, Ted is summoned to the museum curator's office and sent on a mission to Africa to look for a mysterious item that will bring visitors back to the museum. Ted heads to the Outback Outfitter store where he is fitted with his trademark yellow suit.Once he arrives in Africa with the crew, Ted is shocked to discover what they felt would be a huge item that would save the museum, is actually a small little statue that fits into the palm of his hand. Ted does meet a curious, fun little brown monkey. As he leaves Africa set for the shores of America, the little monkey, who has taken his yellow hat, stows away on the ship. Soon after he arrives back home, Ted discovers that the little monkey, who he names George is a part of his life at home.Kids will really love this film--mine did. The DVD also includes some cool bonus features. The games are easy to play with the DVD remote. There are also DVD-ROM features. The running time of Curious George is one hour and twenty eight minutes."
432,dvd,This is a great movie. I think Al Pacino and Robin Williams definitely clicked in this movie. The plot was excellent and Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time
433,dvd,Al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate A murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it. He has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner. He creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer (robin williams) did it. Very good movie
434,dvd,"This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place. Even though I give this remake 4 stars, mainly because Al Pacino and Robin Williams restrained themselves, and that Hollywood changed the ending. Check out the original. I give the Danish original 5 stars."
435,dvd,"I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops. First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling ""Police, you're under arrest.""They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort. Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too? Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough. By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too"
436,dvd,"Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, ""ever since I saw Batman Begins"" and find his artistic vision to be incredible.The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice.However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this. "
437,dvd,Al Pacino plays the morally conflicted police officer with some secrets who is doing his best to help solve a murder in Alaska during the long days of summer when the sun never sets. The white landscape and the gray mental clarity from his insomnia make this an interesting psychological morality tale.Patrick J. McGerve
438,dvd,"It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so"
439,dvd," Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" is a fantastic film, that manages to top the original. This police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end. Al Pacino has one of his best roles in years.(He's still the man!) Robin Williams was better in ""One Hour Photo"", but he's not glaringly miscast as others claim.The rest of the cast is first-rate, with Hillary Swank being particularly good. The credit for this film's greatness belongs to Director Nolan. He's created a tense,visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches, and stands as one of the best movies of the decade. "
440,dvd,"This is one of the ""big"" 1960s Warner Bros. musicals.While definitely not in the same class as ""My Fair Lady"" or ""The Music Man"",it's as good as ""Finian's Rainbow"" and MUCH better than ""Camelot"".Leonard Speigelgass's script wisely lets Arthur Laurents' book virtually speak for itself.John Beckman and Ralph Hurst's sets,Orry-Kelly and Howard Shoup's costumes,Harry Stradling's photography,and Frank Perkins's musical direction are all excellent.Mervyn LeRoy's direction is very good,especially in the dramatic scenes.The cast is excellent,withRosalind Russell,Natalie Wood,and Karl Malden particularly outstanding.Faith Dane,Roxanne Arlen,and Jean Willes stop the show with ahilarious ""You Gotta Get A Gimmick"".All in all,a good 1960s musical that provides an evening of solid entertainment"
441,dvd,"I love musicals and ""Gypsy"" is one of my faves.I adore Rosalind Russell's portrayal of Rose and love Natalie Wood, too. It's really got it all. Great songs, great performances...a classic I can watch over and over"
442,dvd,"My mother took me to the movies to see Gypsy, starring Rosalind, when I was about 10 years old.  I fell in love with the movie.   Natalie Wood became a beautiful swan.  I just love that movie.  I watched the movie with my daughter although she had seen it on tv with all the commercials.  She enjoyed it so much I am going to purchase her a copy."
443,dvd,"Based on the hit Broadway play, Mervyn LeRoy directed this under-appreciated musical gem. Rosalind Russell is Mama Rose, the mother of all stage mothers, grooming her two young daughters for stardom on the vaudeville stage. She pays special attention to her youngest child, blond Baby June, while Louise is relegated to the background. As time goes on, the vaudeville craze fades with the coming of talkie films, and now her bubbly blond darling, Danity June (Ann Jilliann), is desperate to break free, deserting the family act. Rose is forced to start from scratch, with wallflower Louise (Natalie Wood, who was always in her sister's shadow), as the headliner in a new act, which basically goes nowhere. One day, Rose and her troop, now called Rose Louise and her Hollywood Blondes, wind up in a burlesque theater, and young Louise finds herself drawn into the the role of a stripper. She sheds her shy persona and becomes the world's most famous stripper, Gypsy Rose Lee.Ethel Merman originated Rose on the stage, but Roz Russell does more than an adequate job, despite the fact that her singing voice was dubbed in some musical numbers. She is strong, overbearing, a little eccentric, but at the same time, she commands the audience's sympathy when she realizes that her ambition has just driven her daughters away, and she finds herself alone, with no one to live through anymore. Natalie Wood gives a touchingly vulnerable performance, her thin but endearing singing voice expressing Louise's pain and confusion in extraordinary volumes. Since she was groomed by an obsessive stage mother herself, Wood really had the the material to draw from; her lessons from the real Gypsy Rose Lee undoubtedly helped in her character's transformation from a shy girl to sophisticated stripper (the striptease numbers are fabulous). Who doesn't shed her a tear when she sings, ""Little Lamb"", or feels enthralled as she performs ""Let Entertain You""? As she studies herself before a mirror prior to her first night on the burlesque stage, she sees her beauty for the first time - ""I'm pretty - I'm a pretty girl, Mama!"" When she makes her mark, she engages in an argument with her controlling mother, bringing both to a heartache, and later, an understanding. ""You really could have been something, Mother,"" Louise informs Rose after catching a bit of her ""performance"" on the empty stage.Having seen the 1993 version starring Bette Midler, I still prefer this one; no matter what anyone says, Roz is not miscast, and this film does not, in my opinion, have any ""clumsy"" moments; it is a vintage Hollywood musical. Karl Malden gives a comedic and committed performance as Rose's suitor Herbie, who wants her to marry him and who wants to provide a home for her kids. A young Morgan Brittney plays little Baby June; seeing her makes you think of her as the ""Jon Benet"" of the 1920s. It's finally on DVD, as it deserves to be; the letterbox enhances the film in a way that pan-and-scan videos never could.Everything's coming up roses . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
444,dvd,"I loved this version as a little girl , and grew up with it.I usually do not comment on others reviews , but I feel I MUST respond to a comment ,that this version of Gypsy is definately NOT a classic.SO WRONG ! How could anyone say this masterpiece is NOT a classic ??It is the role that made Natalie Wood a star!The movie is wonderful,and as far as Roz not having a good singing voice,I believe that was done ON PURPOSE.I am quite sure the producer/director knew she had a rough voice. She portrayed a ""tough broad"" as some might say , who was street smart , and some songs don't have the typical ""good voice"" to them - Look at Joe Cockers ""You are so beautiful"" His voice cracks more than once , and especially at the end of the song, and THAT song STAYED number one for a very long time , and is still a classic today...so yes , her voice is rough , but again I say , that was intentional.Her whole demeanor was rough around the edges.As far as all the characters being mismatched , I feel quite the contrary. They meshed beautifully.The movie has that wonderful nostalgic quality that puts you right there , and you really feel for all of the characters. This musical has such DEPTH , Great acting/singing , It's fun , and snappy ,and happy ,and sad ,and ... just everything that movies today aren't .This musical is pure entertainment ,It actually takes you away and puts you right there ,feeling all the emotions of the characters :The sadness of Mama's favortism toward June. Louise's anger toward her mama, The Mama's sadness at Louise's rejection of her after she becomes a stripper. The sadness of Joe(?) (It's been so long I can't even remember if this was his name) when Roz wouldn't marry him. The upbeat song ""Mama get married today"" and the so very sad song ""Little hen Little fish"" that Louise sang to her Birthday present...you definately get caught up in the performances.I say , If you've never seen it: Watch it. If you HAVE seen it: Revisit it again. It is like seeing an old friend. I haven't seen it in a long time, but I have looked for it in different stores under musicals or classics, and I can never find it. Hopefully I can find a copy on Amazon.I always wished they would make a Gypsy 2 set in that era , but of course , even if they did , it couldn't touch the original...Which brings me back to my point in the beginning , It is a CLASSIC , and a great one at that , and always will be.I just wish I could give it TEN stars "
445,dvd,"I give this version 2 stars, 1 for Natalie Wood, who is superb, and 1 for the story itself. Rosiland Russell who was a great actress,(Auntie Mame, The Women), but definately not a singer, is miscast big time!! If they had done the right thing and cast Ethel Merman, the combination of Merman and Natalie Wood would make this a classic today, which it definately is not. The Bette Midler version is far superior"
446,dvd,This is by far the best version of this musical. The song and dance numbers are excellent and the characters strong. Orchestration is bright and snappy and true to the original stage score.A classic that every serious collector should have !
447,dvd,"I suppose it's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal, manipulative mothers"
448,dvd,"I love ""Gypsy."" I remember seeing this film when I was 7 with my Mom and Sister,and it was condemed by the Catholic church.My Mom was so worried she would go to hell when she found out later this was on the list of movies not to see.Everyone is fantastic,and I love Natalie Woods performance,but this is Rosalind Russell's movie.She's so funny,and the energy this women had is unreal,and for a person who can't sing,I could hear her version of ""Everythings comming up Rosses"" everyday,and still enjoy it.This is a Classic,and I'm going to watch this DVD again tonight"
449,dvd,"The catch phrase used repeatedly in this 1962 Warner Bros screen version of the Broadway classic ""Gypsy"" is ""let me entertain you!"", and that is certainly what this wonderful musical succeeds perfectly in doing. Boasting off screen credentials such as Stephen Sondheim for lyrics, choreography by Jerome Robbins and direction by Hollywood veteran Mervyn Leroy, with a superb cast from the legendary Rosalind Russell, through to Natalie Wood and Karl Malden, you just know this movie is going to be something special. Debate still rages over the casting of Rosalind Russell in the central role of the stage mother from hell, Rose Hovick in place of Broadway legend Ethel Merman who had one of her greatest Broadway triumphs in the role. In much the same way as Audrey Hepburn's casting as Eliza Doolittle over Julie Andrews in ""My Fair Lady"" drew heated discussion, the debate over ""Gypsy"", will undoubtedly continue forever. Rosalind Russell certainly makes the central character of the pushy, dominering stage mum her own here and provides in my belief much of what is memorable in this film version of the classic story. Indeed ""Gypsy"", still has that warm appealing show biz flashiness about it that makes a viewing a wonderful nostalgic experience. There have been many back stage stories filmed but ""Gypsy"", is certainly one of the best of it's kind and boasts many fine qualities that allow it to stand on it's own artistic merits side by side with its illustrious Broadway parent.""Gypsy"", of course recounts the rise to notoriety of one of last centuries most famous burlesque queens, the one and only Gypsy Rose Lee. Of course the most colourful character in the story and the one most prominently featured in Arthur Laurent's book on which the play was based was that of the mother the unstoppable Momma Rose Hovick who was unrelenting in her push to see her daughters as stars of the vaudeville circuit. The film chronicles the ambitions of Momma Rose through a long series of performing engagements across America where the spot light is always on the youngest of the three times married Rose's two daughters, June. In an act headlined by ""Baby"" June (Morgan Brittany billed as Suzanne Cupito), who slowly develops through the years into ""Dainty"", June (Ann Jillian) the format never changes and finds elder daughter Louise reduced to being the front end of a cow prop used in the act. Rose has an unfailing belief in the talent of her daughters and brushes aside the attentions of besotted manager Herbie Sommers(Karl Malden), because he wants to marry Rose, settle down and give the girls a proper home in one place. As the years go by the families fortunes take a turn for the worst and the great Depression wipes out the last vestiges of the old vaudeville circuit. Living from hand to mouth ""Dainty June"", becomes tired of always playing a child and runs off and gets married. Rose turns her attention on the less extroverted Louise and revamps the act to spotlight her. However all the magic has gone and when the troupe are booked in as a support act at a burlesque theatre the whole group's lives are changed forever. Louise is dragged in to replace a missing act and despite it involving a strip tease number Rose sees the chance for Louise to gain star status and thus ""Gypsy Rose Lee"", is born. Louise becomes an unexpected sensation and celebrity in burlesque however Rose begins to feel shut out and having also lost Herbie who tired of waiting for her to marry him she sees a lonely old age on her own ahead of her. However in the best tradition of show business a reconciliation occurs at the eleventh hour which sees the overpowering Momma Rose back in her daughters life for a happy finale. Coming on the heels of its Broadway predecessor this movie version does not suffer at all for the changes in cast. Rosalind Russell a fine comedian from right back in the 1930's does a wonderful job of bringing this monsterous but still likeable stage mother to life. The character is essentially a combination of many notorious Broadway and Hollywood stage mothers and she brings her great comic skills to the forefront to make Rose the most meaty character in the story. What is important about Russell's performance is that she always manages to bring the deep down humanity behind the ruthless ambition into her playing of Rose and her scenes towards the end of the film when Gypsy has discarded her are nothing short of brilliant in turning audiences sympathies back onto her character. Natalie Wood, one of Hollywood's most beautiful young women of the time plays the central role of Gypsy and she displays just the right elements of awkwardness and vulnerability in her early scenes combined with the supreme confidence she displays in the later scnes when she is a great success as a burlesque Queen. She has great chemistry with Rosalind Russell and their scenes when the power base in the relationship changes are especially noteworty. Karl Malden has the difficult role of Herbie, Rose's long time love and he makes great dramatic worth out of his decades long love for a woman more interested in turning her children into stars than getting married to him. His departure scene when he finally says goodbye to Rose is particulary poignant. Finally young Ann Jillian deserves special mention for her wonderful playing of ""Dainty"", June, Momma's favourite who is never allowed to grow up in the act. The scenes of her as a teenager still playing a baby are both comical and tragic if there is such a thing possible. The overall production of ""Gypsy"", does great credit to its Broadway parent and the period recreation over many decades, stunning costumes designed by the legendary Orry Kelly and the wonderful choreography by Jerome Robbins is first rate. Despite her different singing style to Broadway's Ethel Merman, Russell handles the musical numbers with relish including ""Everthing's Coming Up Roses"", ""Some People"", ""You'll Never Get Away From Me"",and ""Rose's Turn"".While I'm not an authority on Broadway musicals I always find ""Gypsy"", has a fresh and endearing quality to its story that while being at times brash is also sensitive and moving in its quieter moments. Would Ethel Merman have made the part of Rose a truly memorable creation in the movie version? Who knows but what we have here is one of the better early 1960's Hollywood musicals that succeeds on many different levels. Put some time away soon and catch this great Hollywood musical, Rosalind Russell is sure to dazzle you with her energy, and with the uniqueness of her stage mum to end all stage mums, enjoy!!! "
450,dvd,"Without a doubt, Dave Chappelle created one of the greatest shows to air on television, but I might just be saying too much...or not. Everything he does will crack you up and if it doesn't you have no sense of humor. While I don't have the first season yet, I have seen the whole thing, and it is worth the purchase 100%.Dave Chappelle isn't a blind comedian who let's power get in his way. He knows what's best for him and that is another reason why he is one of the best comedians in America today. There are many hilarious sketches that somehow were beat by the next season, but that's no reason to skip this set!This contains all the episodes fully uncensored, as we want them and funny as h e l l commentary by Dave and Neal. There are also bonus features that need your attention. There is no thinking over to do, go buy it now"
451,dvd,"    this was and still is one of the best skit comedy shows out at the time. dave's natural gift of comedy is very well suited to this outrageous and howling,profaine,and insightful show. mr. chappelle has taken some great bits and turned skit comedy on it's ear! this set isn't for everyone,but if like me the skit of the blind,black white supermacist(watch to understand) is just the funniest bit i have seen in years.     like i said this is not for all taste as the laungage is very corse and the skits are very much geared for adults(keep the kids away!!!), but for those with the sence of humor to like dave this is a great collection to have!"
452,dvd,"The  Chapelle show is equal parts hit or miss or near-miss. For every brilliant sketch that has you simultaneously shaking your head in amazement while you slap your knee in amusement (a hit), there is a bit where you just shake your head at how embarrasingly lame it is. (The miss.) And then there are the solid bits that are pretty funny, but no great shakes.HITS: A blind black white supremacist? Genius. And for some reason, I love the musical interlude where Dave and Mos Def cruise around while Mos Def raps.NEAR MISS: The Real World sketch with a white guy staying with some of the most criminal blacks that Dave and his writers could concoct was so ""real"" and cruel, it was just brutal... yet kind of funny too.MISS: Lots and lots of lame sketches"
453,dvd,"Chappelle's Show is a hilarious piece of work that should be required viewing for all.Some sweet stuff like the R. Kelly Spoof,Dave playing a psychic,The magic Video Camera,Spoofs of famous movies like Deep Impact,The Matrix and Pretty Woman,and so much more makes this set a must have for anyone.A Highly Reccomended Laugh Riot. 5 stars and a bag of chip"
454,dvd,I got the Dave Chapelle's Seasons 1  2 for my husband as a Valentine's Day gift and he loved it.  Definitely recommended!
455,dvd,This DVD is hilarious.  It is well worth the money and I can watch it over and over again.  Dave Chappelle is a great comedian and I am just sorry there won't be any more seasons to purchase
456,dvd,The funniest show around!This is the funniest show i've seen since Mad TV. Dave Chappelle is a genius. I put him up with Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy any day.This dvd was crazy. I really loved the Crack Head (Tyrone Biggums). You really need to get this dvd. You do not know what you are missing!!!!
457,dvd,This dvd rocks!  This dude is as funny as they come.  Very original and different.  The new king of comedy
458,dvd,"After being thouroughly amused by Chapelle's Show Season 2 on DVD I purchased the Season 1 DVD box set, since I had only seen a few shows from the debut series.  While this is a worthy set to own, it's not as funny as the second season.  Few of the skits will have a lasting effect on you and just arent memorable.  It's funny but just not as funny as the season 2 DVD box set"
459,dvd,"I really didn't think I was going to like this show, but it's actually pretty good.  It isn't the funniest thing I've ever seen, but it's well done, decently funny, the characters come across as real people for the most part, and there isn't any smug condescension towards them.  The performances are good for this type of thing.  Some of my favorite moments are Thomas Lennon's closeted gay cop getting his bike stolen constantly, the jokes the cops play on unsuspecting motorists (like arresting the pizza delivery guy so they could take his pizza), the episode where the ""homeland security"" guy fools all of the Reno police department, and when the FBI comes in for a murder investigation, and reduces the department to a bunch of gophers.  You're not going to see groundbreaking, brilliant satire here, but you won't be bored, either.  Overall, a decent series.       "
460,dvd,"When you love being with the characters of a show, does the plot-line matter?  The answer is 'yes' if you are a fan of the only reality show on TV, 'COPS.'Much like the comedy classics 'WKRP,' 'Mary Tyler Moore,' 'Cheers' and others, 'Reno 911' gives us characters who are fun to be with.  They are confused, silly, illogical, occasionally dim-witted and even racist at times.  A camera zooms in on any one of them seemingly out of nowhere at a moment's notice and shows us glimpses of them engaged in petty workplace back-stabbing, gossip or romance.  In the meantime, they are all in sheriffs' department uniform, crashing the police car, conducting stings that go wrong, firing their guns with reckless abandon, deciphering vanity plates on cars while in high-speed pursuit, and chasing bizarre criminals around Reno or its trailer parks.  (In addition to being on the Reno police force, Niecy Nash, also the star of the home improvement show 'Clean House,' provides face-blurred cameos of a wacko woman with a penchant for disturbing the peace and stealing police cars and weapons.  In the final episode, watch for Garcia, played by Carlos Alazraqui, to lose it and disappear off-camera laughing hysterically at Ms. Nash's escapades.)I discovered 'Reno 911' while channel-flipping and tuned in for a few repeat episodes because a) it was truly funny, and, b) was a spoof of one of my all-time favorite shows, 'COPS.'  I had never bought a television-show-on-DVD before and decided that I wanted to give this one a try and watch this particular series sequentially and commercial free beginning with episode 1.  I am so glad I did.  Thankfully, there is no laugh track, nor is there one on TV either.  Each episode is skillfully and evenly written and produced, very funny and stands alone.  (Some episodes also include audio commentary.)This stuff works.  Highly recommended for all students of comedy and fans of 'COPS."
461,dvd,It is hilariously quirky. Very random just as I like i
462,dvd,"I was first introduced to this show by a friend in the USA (I'm in Australia) who asked if I'd seen it. No, I hadn't. Then I saw an episode on cable in a hotel and I knew what he was talking about.The situations are great - lots of improv but you'd never know it - it's very natural. This show is the funniest on tv, I bought a multi-region DVD player just so I could watch this. I know some Cops who have seen it and they say it's funny as hell. You can't get much better than that. Lot's of ""in"" jokes for real Cops too. If you know a cop, buy it for them!I love the start of shift briefings - quickdraw to see who has to go out and buy lunch. THAT is funny"
463,dvd,THIS SEASON IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN FOLKS. IT WILL HAVE YOU ROLLING ON THE FLOOR OVER AND OVER. IT IS WORTH IT
464,dvd,Great shows! Had to call 911 to help me stop laughing.  It's just too funny
465,dvd,"Amazon was spot on again, with fast delivery and the show was what i expected. For anyone who has seen the show you know what to expect. For those who haven't it will be a fun new experience"
466,dvd,"A truly original series of non-stop laughs.  Pay attention, there is a lot of subtle humor that is brilliant but not always caught the first time around.  Dangle and the gang are great"
467,dvd,"Reno 911 is one of the best comedy spoofs on television today.  The comedy is original and catches the viewer unaware.  The set-up of the jokes and the visual punch lines provide a new type of comedy entertainment, in the same way as the Monty Python routines broke new comedy ground.  The actors of Reno 911 portray a wonderful combination of sterotypes that significantly enhance the full-force humor of the series.  Few TV comedy shows have ever arrived at the level of Reno 911.  When watching Reno 911, you don't just smile, you don't just chuckle, you laugh out loud and in this day and time, ""it don't get much better than that.""     "
468,dvd,"This show is one of the funniest on comedy central today.  It's full of over-the-top, sick humor that just keeps you laughing through each episode.  Definately worth buying the first season on dvd"
469,dvd,"This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given ""evil empire"" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them? Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, ""McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!"")The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run.What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur"
470,dvd,"Nothing can be better than ""The Firm"" written by John Grisham, who himself is a lawyer. The attentions to details that Grisham manages to pull are just fantastic. I read the book before watching the movie, and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book, as the book gets slow in between, but not the movie. Cruise's is superb, so are the other actors in this movie. I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences. "
471,dvd,"The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie. Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life.   At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham. The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into.Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes. Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain"
472,dvd,This is a smartly written and fast-paced drama.  Tom Cruise plays a sharp young Harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob.  Great supporting help from Gene Hackman and Wilford Brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors.  
473,dvd,"The Firm,it`s a great story, and an amazing movie.i`v read the story, and just now, i watched the movie. it`s great to read the story and then watch its movie, you`ll be able to see what you imagined while reading the book!i recomend the firm to all! and if you can get the book and read it first, it`ll be more fun! Trust me!Enjoy"
474,dvd,"I hate lawyers.What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: ""First, let's kill all the lawyers!"". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: ""get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"" Exactly. Anyway, ""The Firm"" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel ""The Firm"": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in ""The Firm"", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and ""The Firm"" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of ""The Firm"" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of court.Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, ""The Firm"" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: ""The Firm"" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.  Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed. JS"
475,dvd,The DvD is great and so was the price.  The movie is EXCELLENT!!!  Can't stop watching it!
476,dvd,"I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice.  It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock  a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out.  The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie.  Everyone else does a great job of acting here.  To me though, Tom is miscasted.  He seems to be out of place.  His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do.  Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned.  Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well.  A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here"
477,dvd,"This romantic comedy was charming, funny, and clever. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem with heavy British accents. (If you do, try it with captions). It was fun, funny, and a nice pick-me-up when one needs a lift"
478,dvd,"If you're looking for exciting chase scenes, gratutious nudity, explicit sex scenes, and formulaic mega-spectacle, then this one is not for you.  But, you will love this movie if you love dance, dancers, searchers for true love, cynics whom true love find, oddballs who find their one true soul mate, and good guys who win in the end.  All in one underrated and underreviewed masterpiece.  Ignore the naysayers.  Take a chance and see this one.  Share it with someone you love.  You will not regret it"
479,dvd,"It isn't great drama, but all in all it is interesting. Craig Ferguson is great in it, he even sings.  He make the whole film worth watching."
480,dvd,This was a fun movie! Salsa lovers will relate.  New Salsa lovers will really relate
481,dvd,"I love this film (obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot), to me it's the quintessential Brit flick - absolutely what we do best - but I don't consider it a Rom Com at all.  It's very bitter sweet, and if all you're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you're missing the point of this film.  Every character had a dark thread running through them, a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made.  But it's also about hope, and the message that I get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past, you can always overcome them or redeem yourself.Adrian Lester was, as always, wonderful at the emotional epi-centre of the film.  BTW if you ever get the chance to see him do Shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go, he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween'.So, my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film"
482,dvd,"Hubby and I have finally solved our problem of being unable to understand English accents that are other than what one hears on the BBC and are referred to as ""posh"" or upperclass.  We now turn on the English subtitles and watch them that way.  It used to be that fifteen minutes into a movie like this we'd be turning it off because we had such trouble understanding them.  With the advent of English subtitles being on all DVDs, those days are over.  The film is a relationship film set in London and involves rougly 7 different men and women and their attempts to get together through the use of their local Salsa dance club.  Every character in here has relationship problems but they tend to be funny ones.  There is minimal contact with the world of divorce and even less with the world of single parenting.  Instead, these are all singles trying to connect and flopping fabulously at it most of the time.  Each character has his or her own eccentricity which is well handled too.  I can't say I need to own this film but for an evening's viewing, it was a lot of fun.  There are two men who play cab drivers in a restaurant who have some absolutely hilarious dialogues with one another.  They aren't part of the other action but as comedy sketches, their scenes together are gems"
483,dvd,"BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types.  And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive.  The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue.  One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male.  The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing.  A lovely film full of surprises"
484,dvd,"You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good.  This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny.  The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked.  I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks).  That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people.  This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either).  Recommended"
485,dvd,"i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it. i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce. this film combines humor, romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly. i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony. i can't wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection. a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways"
486,dvd,"I first watched this movie because cinamatic legand Joan Crawford was one of the stars in it. Joan plays Amanda Farrow, a rather bossy publishing executive. However, her part is small and the movie has little to do with her character. It's a fine picture, though.At first glance, ""The Best of Everything"" looks like ""9 to 5"" meets ""The Devil Wears Prada."" But after the first twenty minutes I was convinced that this was a much more complicated tale about relationships taking place in the Big Apple. The main plot focused on three clerical workers at the same publishing firm, played by Hope Lange, Diane Baker, and Suzy Parker. Each women has their own trials and tribulations. But I think the one thing that they all have in common is that the men in their lives are all cads. I would say that just about all the men in this film are rather unsympathetic and uncaring. Is this how men really were in the 1950's? I hope not.Normally I'd reserve two maybe three stars for a picture like this. But since it's Joan's ""last great picture"" (not counting ""Baby Jane,"" of course) it deserves four"
487,dvd,"If you're an old movie buff, as I am, I think you will like this one. I have seen it on TV  but it is one for the collection. I have watched it twice already since I got it"
488,dvd,"An entertaining soap opera, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING succeeds especially because of its brilliant capturing of 1959.  The attitude, the fashion, the lifestyle, the vernacular and (both ennervating and bittersweet) the culture.  Once you've enjoyed the movie itself, sit back and relish the great commentary track with both the original novel's author and an amusing film historian.  You'll get quite a few chuckles along with fascinating facts about everything pertaining to the film and the times and circumstances around which it was made.Wonderful to see so many great stars in all their colorful glory!  Also included, a trailer and newsreel.  Beautiful trasnfer.  A first rate DVD experience"
489,dvd,"The architecture, fashion, interior design of post-war America is all right here in 50s NYC.  You just can't beat it!!  Yeah, it's corny in more places in one but the overall effect is one you don't want to miss"
490,dvd,"This 1959 soapy saga does indeed have everything: lecherous old geezers making passes at sweet young things, bitter old hags sleeping with married men, bosses who take their frustrations out on underlings, and sex! sex! sex! Rona Jaffe's bestselling book --- think Peyton Place set in Mdhattan --- tells the tale of three young woman who work in the publishing world of NYC ... modern 9-to-5 gals who dream, dare and damn themselves, while wearing terrific Oscar-nominated clothes that they couldn't afford on a secretary's salary. The cast includes Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Louis Jordan, Diane baker and Stephen Boyd; who better to add extra star power than Joan Crawford as a chain-smoking, orange-haired senior editor who treats her employees the way her lover treats her --- like dirt. Sometimes the best films are the worse. Thank God"
491,dvd," I really miss the genre loosely called ""women's pictures"" that combined wonderfully lurid storylines (with laugh-inducing  Hays Code cleaned-up dialog) and major, MAJOR fashion. Unfortunately nowadays the closest we get is the really crude ""Sex and the City"" whose scripts leave nothing to the imagination and where the ""fashion"" comes direct from Walmart.""The Best of Everything"" scores major points for a great looking cast, dynamite clothes,and wonderfully trashy storylines. If this isn't the ultimate popcorn movie, WHAT IS??!!?? Ladies, invite your friends over, rustle up some major munchies, fire up this DVD and have a WHALE of a GOOD TIME!!"
492,dvd,"I remember those days.  I used to dress up for work, the high heels and stockings and garter belts, before pantyhose.  I like this movie and always try to catch it when it's on TV.  I know I'll catch heck for saying this, but I miss those days.  During the so called ""women's lib"" days women were very cruel to other woman who wanted to be married and raise a family.  I used to say back to these woman ""this is America, we have a choice"". Of course I was shouted down so I learned to keep my opinions to myself. Whatever we've gained from ""women's lib"" (much, much more work, if you ask me and our children are suffering for it)doesn't make up for all we've lost"
493,dvd,"There are some wonderful reasons to add the newly released-on-DVD ""The Best of Everything"" to your film library. For one, it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into New York City circa 1959. Fox certainly has done a commendable job with the DVD--the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear. Cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch, because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by Deluxe brought to sparkling life. The film is very, very lush. From the beginning, when the screen fills with a sunny view of the Manhattan skyline to the sounds of Johnny Mathis crooning the Oscar-nominated theme song, you know you are in for grand entertainment. All of the performances are fine, with Crawford a standout.I think it's funny that although Joan Crawford only has five to ten minutes of screen time in ""The Best of Everything,"" her picture is featured very prominently on the back and front covers of the DVD. The casual watcher may never know that the ultimate movie star had a only a supporting role, yet with that tiny role she managed to steal the entire picture and make it her own!  That's star power!As enjoyable as the film is, it is incredibly flawed. If one was interested in sexist attitudes (concerning men AND women) and how they have changed since the 1950s, there couldn't be a more relevant movie to watch. It is shocking, and sometimes disturbing, how much attitudes have changed. For example, at one point during the movie, Catherine (played by lovely Hope Lange) is told by David, one of her romantic interests, that once she has proven to herself she can make it in the publishing world (which, in his view, could be the only reason a woman might have some kind of ambition) she should quit it all, get married, and ""love happily ever after."" Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to be in love happily ever after, but it certainly represents a double-standard. Who would ever tell a man such a thing?  Could you imagine Hope Lange telling David that a man's ambition is only him trying to prove himself, and that he should cut it out and love happily ever after? (now I can imagine Joan Crawford saying that to Clark Gable, but there weren't any characters with that kind of will or independence in this film). So much of the dialogue and morality in the film is dated, and some of it is very disturbing, but there are still some good things about the story. There are some great viewpoints on love, and how casual dating and hookups can hurt people, and my favorite line has to be, ""Here's to men, with their clean-shaven faces and their dirty little minds."" It's funny to say the least!"
494,dvd,"Yes, please take me back to 1959, to New York in 1959, or even back to Rio de Janeiro, a couple of years before, where I met Rona Jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous ""Sacha's"" nightclub, where Rona was already drafting her novel mentally...When the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the Seagram's building, one could actually walk-up to lovely Suzy Parker and chat with her about how real was the ""new morality"" of the liberated New York girls in the executive suites, decades before Sex and the City became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the Sixties.At night we had the many parties thrown by Negulesco and his charming wife, while Stephen Boyd was being charming to my wife, Brazilian actress Mariza Woodward, featured in LIFE Magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in Rio.Oh, yes, take me back!And if you were not there then, if you were not even born then, do get this DVD and visit New York 1959 and see how charmingly it all started, despite where it eventually ended"
495,dvd,"As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories.  The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona.  This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's.  Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960.  The people were wonderful to grow up with.  This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer.  I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD.  I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts.  Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating"
496,dvd,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, ""OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance."" ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time"
497,dvd,"Love this movie, caught some of it on TV one week so then did a search on Amazon and brought the movie. Family entertainment Loosly based on the real life Frank T Hopkins who did more to save the wild Mustang than any other"
498,dvd,"Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all.  Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the ""Ocean of Fire"" in the 1890's.This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver.  The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a ""cowboy'.  We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke.  And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American.  This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins.Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world.  When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life.Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity.  Viggo must have definitely ""lived"" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them.  He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing.  Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series.  This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance.  Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover."
499,dvd,"Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the ""Ocean of Fire"".Highly Recommended"
500,book,This all-Spanish handbook for parents with new babies will prove essential for any concerned about a child's health. Manual Pediatrico appeared first in English; the Spanish edition provides essential health information at a glance for parents unversed in medical care; and should be a mainstay of  any Spanish-speaking home with children
501,book,"McCarthy's writing and portrayal of Lester Ballard, a necrophiliac, is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape. And then you have to wonder...why am I siding with a necrophiliac of all people? The writing is up to the high standards expected of McCarthy, and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche. The book has an interesting twist to the plot - Ballard is falsely accused of rape, his house is auctioned off and he's left as a social outcast, an animal. He is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal. If you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read"
502,book,"Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so ""grotesque"" or ""disturbing"" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time"
503,book,"I was initiated into the world of Cormac McCarthy with this novel in Southern Lit class.  My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to"
504,book,"I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was ""WE SELL THE EARTH."" C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community"
505,book,"There is no denying the strain of Faulkner that runs through McCarthy's early works; like his predecessor, McCarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place (here, the hills of Eastern Tennessee) interact.  But McCarthy is more fun to read; his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind's eye.  He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  ""Child of God"" is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.  But that is one of the great joys of Cormac McCarthy's early novels--they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of  beautifully painted landscape and haunting, nightmarish imagery"
506,book,"I have read sevral of McCarthy's other novels. His best ones stretch something to the limit.  In <Blood Meridian> it was violence.  Here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings.  Lester Ballard is the ultimate user.  Other people exist for him only to meet his needs, even if they are dead.  I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.  I don't think the title is meant to be ironic.  I think we are meant to see that even Lester Ballard really is a child of God"
507,book,"This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs"
508,book,"If you're considering buying the Peter Smith ""edition"" of this book, note that it is NOT a new ""edition"" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book"
509,book,"What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association.  It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like ""is the kennel business for me?"" and ""what are the main issues in kennel management?""  Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US.  For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag"
510,book,"""Ha ha ha hah ha hah!""  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this ""Tolkein as faith"" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the ""thanks for the buck buddy"" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for"
511,book,"The Protector's War (2005) is the second Alternate History novel in the Change series, following Dies the Fire.  In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.In this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.When the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.Nigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.At Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.Lord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.In McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.This story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.BTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?Highly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.-Arthur W. Jordi"
512,book,"I loved Stirling's ""Islands in the Sea of Time"" trilogy, and I also loved the first book in this series.  Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing"
513,book,"It completely sucked. Very long with nothing to say. Author was proud of his own knowledge of the SCA and Wiccans, and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development. What's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters.I now live overseas, so I bought a bunch of books in the ""4 for 3"" price discount section in order to save money. This is the first one I read of the received books. If they're all this bad, I'll be avoiding that discount database in the future"
514,book,"I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like ""what just happened!"". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.There seem to be no faults in the utopian ""good guys"" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional ""Clans"". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it"
515,book,"Yet another fine effort from Stirling.  The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again.  A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed.  The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels.I found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops.  No spoilers, so I won't elaborate other than to suggest ""Gathers the Storm"" or somthing similar might have ben a better title.  Hopefully ""A Meeting at Corvallis"" will be equally entertaining"
516,book,"Mr. Stirling has succeded again.  Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read.  Honestly, I don't know where to start when explaining how good it is, so I will let you know the one thing I found highly disappointing about it, in one word:Wicca.That's right, Mr. Sterling has filled this book with so much ""blessed be's"" and ""Lord and Lady"" junk that you have to actually wade around that gobbledeegook to get to the real story.  In fact, if it weren't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I'd have given this book two, maybe three stars.  Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here.  Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism/Islam in Africa, Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism/Shintoism/Anamism in Asia, etc.  But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the ""Lord and Lady"" actually interact with some of the characters.  Yet the characters don't sit there and think to themselves, ""Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!""  Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind.  Oh, well.  My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum.  We don't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let's try to keep to a minimum the ""blessed be's"" or ""lord and lady"" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay"
517,book,"While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook. I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library."
518,book,"Read this book!  I never thought a history book would be one I could not put down.  It's enlightening and eye-opening.  It's a broad, fascinating history."
519,book,"Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's ""American Colonies"" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do.  This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution.Among the Revolution's motives were ""liberty"" (a better form of government than that provided by London) and ""empire"" (eliminating British barriers to the colonies' territorial expansion).  Since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists' territorial expansion, giving them a larger role in the history, as Taylor does, makes the history read more in the ""imperial"" vein.  See chapter 18, ""Imperial Wars and Crisis: 1739-75.""In an important way, the ""liberty"" and ""empire"" motives both came down to land.  The colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average Briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples.  Jefferson summed up their objective as ""an empire of liberty,"" which Taylor uses as chapter 18's final section heading"
520,book,"The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted. This is one of those times when I wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend"
521,book,"Has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative well-written text by a good historian. That is, unless your car won't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following Monday two days before Christmas.  In that scenario, his good-historian-ness flies out the window and you just hate his guts. Taylor: Not all of us come from big money! Sorry my 80s model car exploded and inconvenienced you so! Thanks for ruining my gpa!Good book though"
522,book,I found this book well researched and full of information I knew nothing about. Taylor doesn't pull any punches when discussing our European ancestors and their brutality towards the native americans they helped destroy. Fascinating reading for anyone interested in our early history
523,book,"We all learned the basics of colonial history in school: the Mayflower; Jamestown; Tobacco; the development of New Amsterdam, Boston, Charleston,  Philadelphia; indentured servants; and French trappers / Spanish Conquistadores.  However, most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760.  Moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and Indians.Despite being an American History buff, it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that I realized how little I knew.  Taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the Spanish, French, English, Swedish, Dutch, German, etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the United States.  There are plenty of fascinating details about exploration, the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies.  More importantly, this book provides a solid background for why the English-speaking colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period.A well-written and well-researched book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about.  This is history that is hard to put down"
524,book,"Traditionally, coverage of ""colonial America"" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage.  Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.His scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.Taylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.As the first book in the ""Penguin History of the United States,"" Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come"
525,book,"Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done"
526,book,"Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans."
527,book,"The above is my favorite book and SLB conjured up similar emotions in me.  I read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter's ""must read"" pile when she is ready for it.  This is one of those books that, when you read it, it forever changes your life.  Atleast it did for me...the same way TKAM changed me and has stayed with me.  I highly recommend this book"
528,book,"The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy.I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested.Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable"
529,book,"I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books.  The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing.  I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia.  You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone"
530,book,"A wonderful, gentle, informative coming of age story. And the reader was a pleasure to listen to"
531,book,"This book really great. I enjoyed the story immensley. Character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized. I really could picture myself at the ""flamingo pink"" house in Tiburon. The main character, Lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across, but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother. The group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life, love, faith and understanding. It's very heartfelt"
532,book,"One of the best books ever!!!!  I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over.  I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair.  Different genre, but also very entertaining!  I have become an overnight, true fan of this author"
533,book,"Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.A very good read"
534,book,The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.
535,book,"Over the years I have read many books on the Red Scare in Hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism.  This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films.  In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists.  In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party.  This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist.  And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings.But this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as right-wing Republicans.  While I am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left, I find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias.  The significance of this book to me from reading Ring Lardner's famous ""I'd Hate Myself in the Morning"" to watching Woody Allen's ""The Front"" and FINALLY getting a closing answer is overwhelming.  I no longer feel the need to explore why Americans chose to follow another government's agenda to the potential detriment of our country.  However, I do not fault these people for their initial attraction to communism and frankly, I don't view communism as wrong:  it's just a different government method some choose.  For myself, I remain quite satisfied with democracy, EVEN in these trying times.  Rather, the attraction to communism was clearly a byproduct of the recent depression as well as the growth of fascism.  I can live with that reasoning.This is an exceptional book if you have any interest in the 50s, movies, or communism.  In closing, I must comment on the complete disrespect shown to Elia Kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when Nick Nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award.  I suggest they read this book.  The Red Scare was a horrible period but Freedom of Speech needs only go so far when supporting a government with intent to overthrow our own.  I strongly recommend this book."
536,book,"While George Clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his ""community"" are proudly out of touch with mainstream America, I was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by Ronald and Allis Radosh. For readers with an interest in the context of the culture-clash between the ""Hollywood elite"" and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and DVDs, this book is an excellent resource.I say the ""context"" of the clash because this is a look at history, and a serious research work too. This is not a book that details the fashionable Leftist obsessions of Clooney, Streisand, Penn, and the rest, and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly. Instead, ""Red Star Over Hollywood"" digs deep into something far more serious and sinister (""sinister"" comes from the Latin word for ""left,"" by the way): the film colony's infiltration by agents of the Comintern, dedicated partisans of Stalin, and other actors, directors, writers, and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the United States.As Clooney's speech -- and even more so, his movie -- make clear, modern Hollywood's sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against ""McCarthyism"" and the blacklist (that's what makes Clooney's self-congratulation so laughable -- does anyone in Hollywood *defend* McCarthy?). But the Radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence (in other words, the witch-hunt turned up real witches), but that there was also a strong and active anti-communist Left in Hollywood. Even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in Hollywood, it was this anti-communist Left that was in the most direct conflict with the Stalinists, their apologists, and their dupes, particularly before and during World War II.All of this is important information, but it's when they turn to their discussion of HUAC and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront Hollywood's defining myth. Far from the usual pop-psychology analysis of the deranged and sweaty McCarthy (and why do so few people seem to notice that *Senator* Joe McCarthy had nothing to do with the *House* Committee on Un-American Activities?) the authors have gone in-depth in committee records, and also into the backgrounds of the people from Hollywood who came before the committee. It's certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of McCarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents. Ronald and Allis Radosh are to be commended for doing the latter.It's because this book is so heavily researched -- so filled with names, dates, and places -- that I note again that it may not be to everyone's taste. It is, I repeat, a work of history. It notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of, say, an Ann Coulter book, and so doesn't have the fist-pumping, take-that-you-commie excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works. But those books seem to disappear as soon as they fall off the bestseller lists. This, on the other hand, is a book that deserves to be around for a long, long time"
537,book,"Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's ""Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left.""Talk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true ""United Frontism"" and ""Popular Front"" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed ""revisionist"" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like ""Mission to Moscow,"" ""The Spanish Earth,"" and ""The North Star."" Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.I enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. ""Red Star Over Hollywood"" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another ""we were innocent"" propaganda piece."
538,book,"I have always been curious about the influence of Communism in Hollywood.  This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it.  It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated.  It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation.  I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful.  The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions.    Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union.  It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union.  Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors.    Finally, the Radoshes put the ""Hollywood Ten"" and the blacklist years in perspective.  They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated.   I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost.  It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed.  Who said you can't win for losing!"
539,book,"This book touches on one of the touchiest and nerve-wracked controversies of the last sixty years. Precisely because of a tendency to close ranks around the defense of semi-myths one needs to zero in from two angles. Here we get the clear effort to indulge in what many would think revisionist propaganda. But despite an obvious bias built in to the account, the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know, but might not, after the shouting matches over McCarthyism. I really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction, but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading. Conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business, but you can read around the lurid conservative passages (not so bad) for some useful corrections of the record, and no doubt much left out."
540,book,"It's no secret that many of Hollywood's and the entertainment businesss's current ""stars"" are socialist afficienados (or worse), but where did this denationalized elitism come from? ""Red Star Over Hollywood"" does a spectacular job at laying out the groundwork and background of the Hollywood political left, Communists and fellow travelers from the 1930's to 1950's. With about 37 pages of reference material (diaries, speeches, Congressional testimony, biographies, autobiographies, news articles, interviews, etc.), the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the Soviet Union in its attempts to ""take over"" Hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a Soviet America. The names of the actors, screen writers, producers etc who were card carrying Communists, fellow travelers, quislings, leftists, and varieties of socialists who made up the Hollywood scene in those days will floor you. You'll have to read the book to find out who they were.  And there were many heroes as well, who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs. You'll never watch movies on the Turner Classic Movies channel the same way again. After you read the book, look closely at the writing and producing credits on these old films.The authors draw some connections between the Hollywood leftists of that era and the current crop of leftists in the ""entertainment industry"" today. But that comes at the end of the book and is a very brief section.This is a must read book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the Hollywood of the 30's-50's and who here's the sophist leftist pontifications of the Tim Robbins, Barbra Streisands, Bill Mahrs and others. One thing that will strike you  is how well educated, thoughful, well read and articulate both the left and the right were in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. There was intelligent discourse on all sides. They make today's left and right apologists seem like 3d graders reciting ""Dick and Jane"" from memory. That insight was worth the price of the book.Gar"
541,book,"I used to wonder why Hollywood ignored the crimes of Soviet Communism, which easily rival the crimes of National Socialism, something they've shown us over and over and over again (certainly understandable). Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin's ""Red Terror,"" the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin's purges of the late 30's, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on ""McCarthyism"" and the ghastly ""blacklist."" They're listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don't believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that's no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over ""McCarthyism,"" the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn't have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps!The Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30's and 40's was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin's mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin's secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin's killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the ""horrors"" of ""McCarthyism.""While no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her ""hero"" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see ""Mao: The Unknown Story"" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood ""useful idiots"" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet's crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" a saintly portrayal of Castro's chief executioner Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of ""counter-revolutionaries"" at La Cabana prison, something that's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro.The negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can't refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts. Hollywood was filled with Stalin-worshipping Reds (now Castro-worshipping Pinkos), the Rosenberg's were guilty as charged and Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy. Truth hurts - deal with it!Also recommended:Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant by Humberto E.

542,book,"The McCarthy era is generally portrayed as one of the darkest times in American history, and those who faced blacklisting in Hollywood have been lauded as heroes. Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party.The Radoshes describe the infatuation of ""the Hollywood Party"" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union.  They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the ""Hollywood Ten"" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the ""Ten"" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work.  The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, ""Mission to Moscow."" This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin's purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed.  Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either ""named names"" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names.  For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration.If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony's long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book.  In the meantime, ""Red Star Over Hollywood"" is well worth reading."
543,book,"The back lash continues against the media strangle-hold on revisionist history.How many times have you watched a documentary or a movie that exhonerates those poor persecuted innocents, dubbed the Hollywood Ten, as sitting targets seated before an array of mean and ruthless right-wing zealots - the HUAC committee of the late 1940's and early 50's?  Over and over and over it seems, doesn't it?  Well now we have a detailed and painstakingly written rejoinder, ""Red Star Over Hollywood"", which tells the real tale; that these were mostly hard core members of the communist party USA, who took their marching orders directly from the Kremlin.  They were Stalin's men and, not to put to fine a point on it, useful idiots in his quest to foment a world-wide communist revolution.Ron Radosh, a communist from childhood, smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the Rosenberg's only to find that .... they were guilty!  After he said so he was unceremoniously drummed out of the ""leftist corp"" and made to wear a political scarlet letter by his former comrades....some friends they.Radosh is a PhD in History and a diligent, detailed researcher of the facts i.e. he's interested in the truth and in that sense wherever the facts lead him he will go.  Unfortunately, one doesn't find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians, archeologists, political scientists, reporters, book publishers or video media types.  As an aside, I found it interesting to compare this book with Neil gabler's, ""An Empire of Their Own: How the Jew's Invented Hollywood.""  The nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a world-wide communistic revolution?  Is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism?  I don't know, but I for one would encourage Radosh to address the subject.  And, he's the man to do it (another book to read as a companion peace would be ""Intellectuals"" by Paul Johnson, the author of ""Modern Times."")It's important to recognize that not all of those in Hollywood, whose lives were ruined by HUAC, were hard-core communists.  Some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices.  To the readers benefit, Radosh teases out these nuances rather well, and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest.Setting the record straight is important, but the Hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a ""fable of innocence destroyed by malice.""  It's their shakey attempt at moral authority, the kind that underpins a Sean Penn in his critique of Bush's Iraq policy, while he ignores the evils of Sadaam Hussein.This book challenges the template of the Hollywood left: that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against right-wing bullies leading a witch hunt against ""un-American activities;"" that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers.  Read it, it's good."

Many recipes are there, but nothing beats having a book that you can carry with you. Some of these will be making their debut at the Thanksgiving table next week and I can't wait!There are some beautiful photos but not a whole lot, but that doesn't take away from the book too much because you can view many of them on the site.Highly recommended.

550,book,I am a big fan of N. Sparks and enjoyed this book as I do all of his books
551,book,Sparks continues to make his readers feel. I hope he continues to write for a long time
552,book,"I use ""The Notebook"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with ""True Believer,"" I was more satisfied with ""The Rescue.""  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,"
553,book,I absolutely Love all of Nicholas Sparks' books.  I have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you.  Get your kleenex's ready. You can't go wrong here.And I always preorder his new ones..... I'm addicted
554,book,I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them
555,book,"I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October"
556,book,"I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like ""The Notebook"" or ""The Wedding"" if you want a good romantic read."
557,book,"I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah"
558,book,"The above is my favorite book and SLB conjured up similar emotions in me.  I read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter's ""must read"" pile when she is ready for it.  This is one of those books that, when you read it, it forever changes your life.  Atleast it did for me...the same way TKAM changed me and has stayed with me.  I highly recommend this book"
559,book,"The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy.I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested.Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable"
560,book,"I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books.  The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing.  I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia.  You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone"
561,book,"A wonderful, gentle, informative coming of age story. And the reader was a pleasure to listen to"
562,book,"This book really great. I enjoyed the story immensley. Character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized. I really could picture myself at the ""flamingo pink"" house in Tiburon. The main character, Lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across, but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother. The group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life, love, faith and understanding. It's very heartfelt"
563,book,"One of the best books ever!!!!  I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over.  I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair.  Different genre, but also very entertaining!  I have become an overnight, true fan of this author"
564,book,"Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.A very good read"
565,book,The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.
566,book,"The Messenger by Daniel Silva is just as interesting, exciting, and intriguing as every other Gabriel Allon bookhas been.  I was hooked on page one and had a hard time putting it down until I reached the last page. My only regret isthat more of the story is not set in Venice, my favorite city. There is just enough of a parallel to characters and events in the real world to make the storiesplausible and just enough romance and action to make it gripping and absorbing. I am already looking forward to the next Gabriel Allon story"
567,book,"well, imho, not as great as the other books in the allon series, but well worth the read!i'm looking forward to the next in the series."

569,book,In this novel we have the characters we have come to love. The writing is tighter and the plot clear. Not quite as exciting or fresh. Some further development with Leah happens which I won't reveal

571,book,"I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad.I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable"

576,book,"I read Bruner's book in one of my doctoral seminars which added a unique perspective on curriculums in early childhood education; however, journeying into the book and determining the main points of argument will challenge due to Bruner's overly dense prose.He highlights the idea of culture defining curriculum through its langauge, customs, history, and society status, but he fails to offer examples accessible to the classroom teacher.I would recognize this book as a added addition to to any Early Childhood Professional's library, but please prepare yourself for many re-reads"
577,book,"This is, by far, the worst book I have EVER been forced to read. One star is too much. The title of this book, ""The culture of education"" leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education. He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. ""Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection."" What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as ""immutable,"" Pontogenetically,"" and ""Hermeneutic."" If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell"
578,book,"This book is a gift for readers. Maybe not all readers, but those who are genuinely interested in human values and culture.  Bruners ideas are bright and deep, making us understand that the future of education depends  on human beings as agents of their destiny. The importance of every  cultures history and the transmission of experiences is only possible  through human interactions.  We cannot be naive and think that technology  is not an instrument of culture. It is, and we must acknowledge it,  otherwise we will be overridden by it. But, education is only possible by  means of intersubjective exchanges: they are the key to the development of  human beings"
579,book,"I don't know about you, but sometimes I stumble upon a book that is a salve to my soul; I am not happy about one thing or another, and I need someone to talk to, talk at, or listen to--I need to look into someone else's life so that I can feel human again and not totally strange and alone.Nora Ephron's HEARTBURN did that for me, and for that I will put it on my bookshelf, along with the many books that have served the same purpose.On my second reading I could not remember if the story was based on the author's life.  I was afraid that I might not enjoy it if it was  pure fiction.  I was wrong.  The book is a very, very funny satire of the Washington scene, whch has not changed.  It is also a tale of real angst and heartbreak.What is basically a sad story has delicious veins of humor, wistfulness, sadness, prosaic pragmatism, and real recipes marbling through it, all of which magically meld into a satisfying whole: but that is what a work of art can do."
580,book,"Every year or so I re-read ""Heartburn,"" one of my favorite novels of all time.  It is fall-on-the-floor-funny, and possibly the best and most memorable form of revenge that a spurned wife ever had.Today's re-reading of ""Heartburn"" was inspired by the revelation that Mark Felt is the real name of Deep Throat, the former FBI mole who fed Watergate information to Ephron's former husband, Carl Bernstein.  In this roman a clef, the chatacter based on cheating-husband Bernstein is called ""Mark Feldman.""  Today I read Ephron's admission, in the Huffington Post blog, that living with the knowledge of Deep Throat's true identity was a ""very heavy burden.""So, was her estranged husband's character name inspired consciously by Deep Throat's name, or subconsciously?I don't really need an answer to that question.  However, it does prove that the novels we love are gifts that keep on giving.  Thanks, Nora.  Thanks, Mr. Felt--for everything"
581,book,"If I had it to do over again, I would have made a different kind of pie. The pie I threw at Mark made a terrific mess, but a blueberry pie would have been even better, since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer.......so Rachel Samstat muses on her marriage to Mark Feldman.Nora Ephron's thinly disguised account of her marriage to famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein is laugh-out-loud funny in parts, though if you're looking for advice on how to save your marriage, the aforementioned tidbit is typical of the advice you'll get.Rachel is seven months pregnant with her second child when she learns her husband is not only having an affair with a mutual acquaintance, but has fallen in love with her. This indignity is compounded because, due to Rachel's advanced preganancy, she can't even date. She does manage one innocent flirtation on the subway which, in true slapstick fashion, leads to armed robbery. Ah, the perils of life flitting between New York and Washington.Short and savvy, this contemporary 80's novel is peppered with recipes since Rachel is a cookbook editor and host of her own cooking show. A collapsing marriage doesn't seem suitable for high-level comedy, but Nora Ephron makes it work and will have you laughing all the way to the bitter end."
582,book,"This book took a little getting used to (This was my first of reading books with recipes within the storylines) , but once I did... boy did I laugh! Great story along with recipes. Who couldn't beat a book that was funny, witty, and full of recipes!! A great read for anyone whom wants to curl up with a good book"
583,book,"I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer"
584,book,"Nora crafted one of my all-time favorite books.  Why I picked up a paperback copy as a freshmen in high school is beyond me.  Why I finally got around to reading it at 18 is also a mystery.  Why I've reread it more times that my dogged copy can tell is no mystery meat; sadness steeped in life's tea.  In real life, I've played the part of the toddler in this tale.  Wish I could say my folks were class acts, such as the author and her former spouse, but chicken fried steak is more common in middle America than Lillian Hellman's Pot Roast. --Laurel82"
585,book,"This is one of contemporary fictions first books. It was written in the early eighties before Bridget Jones became a household name. It is a thoughtful novel about the breakup of a marriage. It is a quick read, but its not an earth-shattering premise. I recommend it for the beach or the bathtub"
586,book,"Now that our democratic system has been eroded almost to the point of no repair, perhaps we should read books like this one to refresh our minds about what this country has always stood for."
587,book,"I am unfortunately not suprised by any of the revelations in this book.  It seems that the vast majority of Americans simply do not care what kind of scumbags claim to ""represent"" us.  Unfortunately, I do not own a multibillion dollar corporation, so I suppose I do not deserve representation.  Hey, didn't the Declaration of Independence say something about people not being represented properly?Oh, pardon me, I have mentioned America's TRUE patriotic roots.  God forbid anyone not agree with Dick  Bush's neo-Nazi (or is that neo- conservative? It's hard to tell.) version of patriotism.Anyhow, I'll save a seat for you other treasonous free thinkers in the prison camp, or Hell.  We all know that those are the only two suitable places for those who do not agree with the ""decider"""
588,book,"This book is a terrific volume for understanding what's gone wrong in America over the past 30 years.  Unlike many best-selling authors, who spout only uninformed opinions and vitriolic ones at that, this guy actually does substantive research on his issues and helps us understand the deeper context behind them: the history, the players, their connections to other folks.  What good is that you'll learn how much of our world is being controlled/destroyed by people and regulations that you've never even hear of or about.  If everyone read this book and spoke up, we might actually preserve this democracy and live better lives.  We'd understand what in our democracy and world is going wrong and have some ideas as to how to fix this."
589,book,"Actually, you can't according to Greg Palast who challenges the results of the 2000 election in which he charges Jeb Bush with instituting his own style of Jim Crow laws to ensure that his brother would get elected. It's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that Bush would have won anyway. Palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up. But Palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote, and the votes that were not counted.He charges that more than 57,000 law-abiding citizens were improperly labeled as felons, and were kept from voting in Florida. These were almost all African-American who universally vote Democrat. There was an 80% criteria for finding a match of felon names. The company Choice Point started with a 90% match, but the state told them that was too high! They were told to make it an 80% match.So, a felon named John Johnson Jr. would also keep a law-abiding citizen named Jack Johnson or John O. Johnson from voting too. When did the state of Florida inform these people that they were on a felons list and could not vote? They didn't, even though they were supposed to give ample notice to allow any mistake to be corrected.The company that got the job of putting the fix in, Choice Point was awarded a multi-million dollar contract over other companies that would have done the same job better for literally pennnies per voter. Florida decided to pay much more per voter with Choice Point.Now here's the lie. Choice Point said that they did not use race as a criterion, but it was used as a matching criterion. Presto! Even with the disproportionate number of Blacks in the prison population, Palasts states that the number kept from voting was statistically way out of proportion to the number of felons.Just to ensure the outcome, the voting machines in Black neighborhoods were fewer and older than the ones in White neighborhoods. In some cases 18% of the Black vote was thrown out for one reason or another while in White neighborhoods were 1 to 2% was the norm. This was the perfect scam since anyone knows that Blacks would overwhelmingly vote for Gore, and the Whites would have had a large voting block for Bush.Florida's official reason was that the law prohibited felons from voting. They didn't want any felons to try to vote. (?)Palast asks, what felon wants to vote so badly that he would risk going back to jail for it? Good point! Not one person in Florida was arrested for voting twice.Then, there were the roving republican goon squads who went to wherever the recount was attempted to intimidate the recount process.Palast accuses the press of doing nothing or investigating nothing about a national election that was obviously rigged. When he offered the story to CBS, a network that has long since cowed to conservative screams of bias, they refused. Why? The CBS executive called the state of Florida to verify the story. They, the state, assured them there was nothing to it? Isn't that like asking the fox if he can be trusted to protect the henhouse? Palast gained a large audience in Europe bringing this story to light. It received almost no attention here, and when it did, it was way after the election.This was the most important part of the book for me. While I enjoyed his commentary on Wackenhut and other exposes, this one was the most riveting. It scares me. This isn't supposed to happen in the US. That is why I recommend this book and especially his newer one, ""Armed Madhouse.""Palast proves by showing leaked documents, pictures and statistic improbability that this and the 2004 election were stolen by electronic ballot stuffing. I thought this was only supposed to happen in a third world nation.Shouldn't someone go to jail for this? Shouldn't we be able to count on it"
590,book,"I read this book in record time.  Greg Palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government'.  I am ashamed that our own US media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government.  From Iran to Iran Contra to Iraq and the Oil fields, from the Halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm.  Thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of ALL the people.  AND HOW IMPORTANT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE FOURTH ESTATE is to your Democracy"
591,book,Palast bares it all. Put me through all 5 stages of mourning- from disbelief to anger to despair
592,book,Greg Palast loves challenges.Bold and sarcastic. Now you can understand why emergent countries will always remain in the third world for the benefit of big corporations and corruptous politicians. Not surprising that all the info provided by Palast was never shown on the america's news.
593,book,"The first time I read this book it was because I'd heard an interview with the author on NPR and felt compelled to get the whole story. It's a fast, entertaining and SCARY read. Don't skip any parts if you can help it - it's not just about corporate and political corruption, it details (with evidence) how this world of ours works and what we need to keep our eyes open for when the bad guys get into our neighborhoods. The sections on what US corporations do in other countries is APPALLING. The sections on the country-destroying terms of IMF and World Bank loans is HORRIFYING. And, if you've ever wondered what the heck public utility privatization is all about, this explains it - AND IT'S UGLY"
594,book,"Devour this book in small bites, or you're likely to choke on the raw truth of it.  Between these covers, Palast demonstrates repeatedly why EVERYone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts.  While I'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations, the policies and actions carried out by the Bush Administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of Palast's claims in broad daylight.If only the mainstream media were paying attention.  Then again, the mainstream media is owned by corporations that make money selling fluff and not upsetting too many of their readers, viewers, and/or listeners.  So why should we expect otherwise?Occasionally, Palast pushes the envelope on his ability to actually KNOW the motivations and responsibilities (blame) of various people he is writing about here.  More often than not, however, he simply puts forth so many facts, and connects so many dots for us, that it's difficult to not come to many of the same conclusions he has.  And, again, the actions of the Bush Administration -- and various members and associates of the Bush family -- have born out many of those conclusions over the past few years.Read this book and compare it with news stories from the past 5-to-6 years and, if you have done any digging at all, you will quickly see how scary the truth really can be.  Hopefully, you'll also see how important it is now to stand up, speak out, and fight for genuine middle class America and those folks even less fortunate than us.  One thing you can put money on, our current government sure isn't looking out for them...or you.Good luck to us all"
595,book,"I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The ""bowel movement"" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book"
596,book,"I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the""shrink"" bashers of the world. This ""play for effect"" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me"

598,book,"How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing.  I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it.  But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did.  I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat."
599,book,"I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up tothe point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore.I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but Ihad to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through"

601,book,"Lula Cruz and her best gay friend, Jeff, embark on a trip to Miami just before College eats her time up. After a series of misfortune, they find themselves working for a somewhat Latin woman, Cece, in a Cuban cafe.SoBe's (South Beach) environment wasn't the only one that caught her attention---a guy named Enrique, a man who you could never go wrong, swooned her heart.But what if Enrique turns out to be her best competition later on?The first time I read the book, I got hooked with it. When I finished reading it, the book left me amused and it somehow satisfied me.What I didn't like in the book was its too predictable. However, because I was hooked in this book the first time I read it, it didn't show (as for me).However, though I enjoyed it, I wish the authors put some sense of ""mystery and quality"" in it---something that keeps the readers guessing until the very end"
602,book,"Eighteen-year-old Lula Cruz is totally stoked about the road trip she'll be taking with her best friend, Jeff, the summer before she begins her studies at a University in Miami. She plans on checking out of hot, sweaty NYC, and diving right in to the cool waters that SoBe (South Beach) provides. However, the two friends are quickly realizing how hard it truly is to be out on their own, with no one there to support them. They get day jobs that totally run them down, and are, how should we put this...totally boring! So Lula and Jeff decide to spice things up by entering a local band contest that could get them televised and everything. The only problem, is that the newest hottie Lula's been hooking up with, Enrique, has also entered the band contest, and is her band's toughest competition. Sure, Enrique is totally mesmerizing to look at, but Lula's not sure if she can trust him with her secrets...or her heart.As a HUGE fan of the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series, I never pass up the opportunity to read their latest releases, which is why SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE quickly caught my eye. Suzanne Weyn  Diana Gonzalez have created an excellent book for anyone looking for an easy read during their Spring Break or Summer Vacation. The characters found in SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE are upbeat, fun, and all feature unique personalities. The romance is cute, and will definitely appeal to pre-teen and teenage girls; while the band competition will appeal to aspiring musicians of the female gender. Overall, this was a wonderful addition to the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series, that will be enjoyed by all.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape"
603,book,"I love all the books in this ""series"" (Royally Jacked, Spin Control, Ripped at the Seams, etc.), and I couldn't wait to read SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE.SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE is about Lula Cruz and her best friend Jeff. They move from New York to South Beach, Florida the summer before they start college, and the trip is a bit of a disaster from the start. Lula is going to stay with her dad, and is planning on getting to know him better, and Jeff is going to be staying with his ultra-strict uncle. When both Jeff and Lula realize that they can't possibly stay where they are, the two of them decide that they have to find an apartment that's relatively cheap. Enter CeCe's Cuban Cafe, a small cafe in South Beach that isn't doing to well business-wise. There's an apartment over the restaurant, and the owner (CeCe) decides that Lula and Jeff can stay there if they offer to work in her restaurant.SOUTH BEACH SQUEEZE is a cute story about friendship, music, and romance. My favorite thing about the book was all the pop culture references, but it's overall a really enjoyable read.Overall grade -"
604,book,Then you will absolutely fall in love with this book. This book is full of images from a wide range of media and artists. The short bios on the artists are short but informative and don't take up much space (more room for pictures). If you're something of an artist yourself then you can certainly pull lots of ideas from this book. I definitely am glad I bought this book
605,book,"Not only the content is insightful, but the design of this book is just wonderful. It is a good source of international drawing's world and a good coffee table book. Get it now"
606,book,"I am disappointed with the quality of the images.  They are the quality of an ink jet printer set at draft quality.  Most of the images are so faded it is difficult to see at all.  I have returned this book, which is something I do once every 1000 books I order, and it is the first art book I have ever returned in my life."
607,book,Beautifully bound and a pleasure to hold...what a book is all about vs the digital stuff.Two small niggles....first; the larger drafted works when reduced for the book become virtually unreadible (maybe they could have got a page each?) and second; the dust cover while beautiful and reflecting the texture and aesthetics of the book is virtually useless for it's purpose as it is too easily torn.I gave it 5 because I'm prejudiced
608,book,It has many interesting works in the book. It is great to have it
609,book,"This is a book that when you first open it up and flip through a couple of pages you will be saying to yourself that you have to sit down with it for a long considered look. Myself, I just looked at the care that Phaidon press took while publishing this, from its rough artistic pages to the in-depth look at contemporary drawing and knew instantly that this was a survey book that I would be opening time and again for years to come.The artists that are covered here are not neccisarily unknown. Pettibon, Peyton, and other long standing luminaries stand along side scores of other artists that I had never heard of. What it is, is a survey of non-illustration/often conceptualy based drawing that is occuring today be the artist known or obscure.If you are into drawing, this is a must have book. One thing to keep in mind is that the format presented here is pretty much along the lines of Vitamin P and the three 'Cream' books. I think all four of these ranged from good to great, if you disagree with this sentiment, you might not like 'Vitamin D.'"
610,book,"David Kennedy's ""Freedom from Fear,"" the 9th volume of the Oxford History of the United States, is a generally exceptionally well researched history covering from the Great Depression to the end of World War II. In this book, Kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians, as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals.I believe most of David Kennedy's interpretations and judgments are well reasoned. However, I disagree with his deemphasis upon the major decline in the stock market between late 1929 - 1931 as one of the main causes of the Great Depression.Even more so I dissent very strongly with David Kennedy's suggestion the Roosevelt administration should have tried harder to avoid war with Japan by essentially appeasing Japanese aggression against China. To quote from his book, Kennedy writes on page 513: ""Why not acquiesce, however complainingly, in the Japanese action in China, reopen at least limited trade with Japan..."" Given the fact that Japanese aggression and atrocities in China were as bad or worse as Germany's in Europe by late 1941, I find Kennedy's opinion morally reprehensible.In general, this is a very good book, covering social, economic, political and military history of the era. However, don't read ""Freedom from Fear,"" expecting to learn much about cultural history in the United States between the Great Depression and World War II."
611,book,"Freedom From Fear is an exhaustive study of America and its people during two of this country's most defining periods, the Great Depression and World War II. David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.This period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.The Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.The New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.The turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.The major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.This book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written. I've studied this period before, but I found this book very rewarding in that I also learned quite a bit I knew little or nothing about. I would highly recommend this book"
612,book,"Despite the newfound popularity of social history, and ethnic history, and gender history, it's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice old-fashioned survey history of America. Heavy on political history, Freedom from Fear tells the story of America during the Great Depression and the Second World War. It is a survey, but it is broad and deep, running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years. David Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning text is worth every penny.Given the two broad subjects, it's not surprising that the book is essentially divided into two sections. In the first, Kennedy takes us on a journey into the downward spiral of the American economy during the Hoover years.  Maligned by history, Hoover could have been a better president than he was, but events overwhelmed him. Even his great success in life prior to winning the White House did not prepare him for the immensity of the task. Indeed, possibly no one could have handled it. But Roosevelt is seen here to have been up to the challenge. Not of actually fixing the problems. Kennedy is quite frank in his evaluation of Roosevelt's New Deal programs and his performance in such matters. In many places Roosevelt could have done better, perhaps by adopting a more internationalist approach to economics, or by not antagonizing and demoralizing the business community.More broadly, we see the decline in living conditions, and at the same time the rise of labor unions and government programs both useful and not. We see the uneven performance of the economy in various parts of the country, and the desperate mobility that sometimes resulted. We see a country scared and in turmoil, unsure of itself and its destiny.But though the Depression dragged on, waxing and waning, events elsewhere in the world did not stop to wait. Though America was among the hardest hit of countries, it was not the worst behaving on the international scene. Rumbles of war began in Europe and in Asia, and America stood aside hoping to avoid it all. Of course this was not to be, and with the Japanese attack America found itself thrust into total war. The economy was finally freed of the doldrums by massive war spending. The people were roused from stupor by the drumbeats of battle. Alliances solidified, and the enemies were targeted. And America joined the war in its own unique way. It could never be said that America takes no advantage of its industrial strength. While the countries of Europe dealt with the situation forced upon them, America armed itself and prepped for battle. It built its forces. It provided machinery and equipment to allies. It transformed factories to a war production mode. Industrial geniuses, pumped with cash, streamlined methods of mass production on a scale never imagined before. And newer and better weapons came to be. More than in most books, Kennedy makes it clear that the American effort in war was a mechanized and deliberate effort. When the Western front opened, it was run with industrial clarity of purpose.If there is a dominant theme in Freedom From Fear, it is that America runs on its commerce.  The business of America really is business. With or without government regulation, with or without organized labor, it is economy that runs Kennedy's America. But with such sweeping vision and engaging style, the reader could do much worse to learn about America in the interesting times than to read this gripping account"
613,book,"There is much to like in David Kennedy's history of the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s.  His book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period.  His examination of the New Deal is both insightful and judicious, while his description of America in the Second World War is gripping and informative.  Throughout the book Kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events, discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the American people and their government.Yet in some respects the volume is something of a disappointment.  The book is a contribution to the superb ""Oxford History of the United States"" series, which has set a high standard with its earlier volumes.  It is by this measure that Kennedy's book is wanting; it is hardly the comprehensive examination of its topic that the earlier volumes were, as his focus on politics and economics gives short shrift to American culture and society during the period.  Moreover, his prose often seems excessively grandiose.  Efforts to create soaring metaphors often become too labored and fall flat, making for a stark contrast with the clear descriptions and jargon-free analysis they buttress.Nevertheless, Kennedy's achievement with this book is impressive.  He has provided a well-written account of America's efforts to deal with some of the greatest challenges that the nation ever faced.  Readers seeking a history of the period would be hard pressed to find a better and more readable book with which to start"
614,book,"With W. Bush preparing to undo the last vestiges of the New Deal, whether you agree with him or not I can't think of a better time, and reason for reading this remarkable study by David Kennedy.Kennedy debunks much of what the remnants of history have left most of us about Herbert Hoover. I think this was the most surprising part of the book because everything I had read, seen, or heard up until now left only negative impressions of the man. I have a both a new respect for Hoover as a man, dour though he was, and a clearer understanding of why he failed as a politician. I also have a fresh reminder of how nothing is really original - FDR borrowed much of the New Deal from Hoover.  But where Hoover couldn't make the ideological leap from good ideas that were to be voluntary only with only minimal government assistance, FDR was amenable to trying anything, including transformational ideas such as mandatory business compliance with Federal regulation, an evening-up of the playing field between business (which had corporatized) and labor (which until FDR hadn't the power to do the same) and labor, to massive government spending. Although FDR didn't understand Keyensian economics, he nevertheless proved the theory.FDR defined the ""general welfare"" clause of the Constitution, and left a legacy that has affected every single one of us ever since, and continues to do so today.Beside the in-depth look at the Great Depression, Kennedy also provides a survey of WWII, debunking many more myths along the way, and exposing the beginnings of the cold war in FDR  Churchill's unkept promises to Stalin about the opening of a second front in Europe.I consider this a ""must read"" for anyone who considers him/herself interested in American History"
615,book,"This is a very literate and enjoyable history. It explains some of the greatest crises of Western Civilization and parades in all their glory heroes like FDR, Churchill, Truman, and Marshall, and it singles out others for less glowing treatment.Professor Kennedy's survey of the period from 1929 to the end of W.W.II is, in my view, the finest of those perilous times. Naturally, the Great Depression and World War II are too vast for any one volume, and if one has an interest in any specific topic, personage, or chapter, the author has provided an unrivalled bibliography to kick off the quest.The professor's writing is simple and straightforward and he knows how to keep his narrative moving at a good clip. This is essential in such a lengthy document. All in all, I'd classify it as a tour de force, essential reading for those interested in the Depression and the War.After the wonderfully enjoyable read, the book sits well on the shelf and comes down quickly for solid reference. This is definitely a five star effort."
616,book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The book is exactly what it says it is, a general history of the United Stated during the Depression and WWII.  I found myself wanting to know more about many topics than author wrote.  This should be expected though as the nature of a book of this type though is that some topics must be treated in a rather cursory manner or left out all together.  The book does provide a vivid portrait of the era and of the events and personalities that shaped it.  After reading it, I can see why it won the Pulitzer prize"
617,book,"""Freedom From fear"" by David Kennedy is a highly respectable history book for the Great Depression and WWII era. Professor Kennedy filled this book with lots of quality research, as well as his own opinions on the Great Depression. In the beginning of this book, Kennedy begins with Herbert Hoover and how he did things ""wrong"", but then he turned to FDR who kept up with the changing economy at that time. Kennedy portrays FDR as powerful and willing for change. He was an inspiring character for those during the Depression. Further into the book, Kennedy devotes his research to the New Deal and the effects it had on the Depression. Kennedy did go into detail about the effects, but he should have researched more about the causes of the Depression. Even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was Kennedy's writing style that made the book hard to put down. It was very enjoyable to read and we recommend it to any history lovers who want to learn more about the Depression"
618,book,"Management new paradigms, strategy, the change leader, information challenges, knowledge worker productivity, managing oneself, Druker proved himself more than capable in his definitions and unique challenge to managers. Rather of a retrospective of his past work ""he set aside to wirte not the known past but the unknown future"".Peter Drucker discusses the profound social and economic changes occurring today and considers how management--not government or free markets--should address these new realities in the workplace. ""Management is Business Management in all kind of organizations"". This book is easy to read. For most content may be wider than how we think management usually is. Druker wrote in his introduction "" the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century"". Peter Drucker discusses how the new paradigms of management have change and will continue to change our basics assumptions and principles of management"
619,book,"Drucker outlines lessons that management can learn from the changing world economy and population.1. Management is not just business management, but is the ability to take advantage of opportunities in sectors of the economy that are likely to experience growth in the future, like education, the professions, and healthcare.2. Recognize that there is not one ideal way to organize an enterprise.  Both ""team"" organization and the ""CEO cult of personality"" have their shortcomings.  It can be difficult for teams to make decisions effectively and popular CEO's must have successors.  You must find the right balance of organization that fits your company's business needs.3. There is no one way to organize employees.  You need to lead workers rather than manage employees.  This is because management increasingly does not know the areas of expertise that employees possess, and employees are now seeking interesting and rewarding work.4. National boundaries and regional markets will become less defining factors of the companies boundaries.  Innovations in an industry don't necessarily come from within the industry anymore.  Further, national governments will be less able to protect local industries from facing the competitiveness of the global industry leaders.  Global competitiveness must become a strategic goal for the business.Drucker also outlines the economic consequences of the declining birthrate in the developed countries.  A declining birthrate means that the working population will become progressively older.  New relationships must be forged with older workers, especially knowledge workers.  Companies that attract and retain knowledge workers past retirement age will gain a significant competitive advantage.Managers must become Change Leaders, who direct inevitable change in a controlled and orderly fashion.  Managers must look to extending the lifespan of their companies and approaching change as a source of business opportunity."
620,book,"Peter Drucker, an editorial columnist for the Wall Street Journal, a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world's most respected management thinkers. His books, over 20 of them, have been called the ""landmarks of the managerial profession"" by the Harvard Business Review.  He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought.  In 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams.'  In 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers' concept.Here Drucker lays out six of the 'new' challenges facing the businesses of the early 21st century.First involves management's new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people.  There is no 'one size fits all' approach.  The method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is 'value.'  Employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers, 'persuaded' rather than 'ordered.'The next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape.  The collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for.  Global competitiveness is a must for survival.  Performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just short-term gains in order to inspire and commit 'knowledge workers' to their mission.Third is becoming a change leader.  Educate others that change equals opportunity.  Regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results.  Enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company.  Study what is working or not in the market with other companies. Don't confuse motion with action.Fourth are the information challenges.  The purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action.  Success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer.  Information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity, competence and allocation of scarce resources information.The fifth challenge lies in vitalizing 'knowledge workers' into high productivity.  Attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow.  Differing from manual laborers, knowledge workers carry the 'means of production' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work.The sixth challenge is managiing ourself (ourselves).  The biggest possible increase in production lies here.  Intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance.  Concentrate on your strengths.  Avoid trying to change yourself.  Ask yourself what your strengths are.  Determine how you work.  Do you like to work alone?  Would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker?  What are your values?  This type of questioning will help determine where you belong.  Most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once.  You must learn what makes 'you' tick.Five Stars"
621,book,"This book is first published in 1999.  Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc.  The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages.  The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.  It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century.  Concepts like ""individuals will outlive their organization"", ""how to defines one's goal and contribution"" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD"
622,book,"Regrettably, Peter Drucker passed away just a few days after I picked up this 1999 release. At the age of 89 (in 1999), Drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business. His chapter on ""Information Challenges,"" at 38 pages one of the longest in the book, Drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data. Few companies exemplify this better than Wal-Mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain.Perhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer, Drucker recognized that ""more and more people in the workforce - and most knowledge works - will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES."" (Emphasis in original.) Drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives, something he himself did.As Drucker put it in his introduction, the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century. With this book, as with all of his others, Drucker may be gone physicially, but his thoughts will live on for many decades to come.Jerr"

Since years, there has been drastic changes in social and economic levels. Management requires re-shaping the business strategies from time to time. Peter offers new paradigms of management with thoughtful implementations of strategic ideas to face the critical areas, weaker spots, problems, practises and how to face in the 21st century.

626,book,"Harper Neeld's book is an incredibly detailed compilation of the author's personal experiences in the sudden loss of her young husband, interviews with other widows/widowers, and discussions of phases of the grieving process.  I would rate this book highly, along with one of my favorite grief authors, thanatologist Alan Wolfelt (e.g. Understanding Your Grief books).  Harper Neeld seamlessly combines her painful, personal story with factual, helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks I have read on widowhood.  I used the introspective questions with my grief therapist, who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught."
627,book,"My friends keep telling me I should write a book about my grief, but I think that what Elizabeth Harper Neeld has written is better than anything I could produce. This book is so readable and covers every aspect of grief. My husband died four months ago, and I have found this book exceedingly helpful. Elixabeth put the most important step first ""To experience and express grief fully.""  There are hundreds of ways to run away from grief, but it is necessary ""to feel it to heal it."" I was given the best advice by a friend who said to ""lean into the pain."" The second choice ""To endure with patience,"" has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself. Thank you, Elizabeth for this beautiful book. I will buy it for everyone I know who loses someone dear"
628,book,"After my husband died suddenly, I was beside myself. My aunt insisted on placing this book in my hands. It has been a lifeline to me. I have purchased well over 20 copies of it for friends and continue to haunt my local bookstore when they don't have it on the shelf for immediate purchase. Having read almost every grief book out there, don't waste your money, just buy this one and learn to live again."
629,book,"My husband of 1.5 years but my soul-mate of a lifetime passed away a year ago. I have read so many books of grief, but only Seven Choices helped me find hope. This book is an honest account of a difficult journey, and like all things that are done with honesty - it touches the core of who we are."
630,book,"I bought this book in audio for a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer after 44 years of marriage.  The day it arrived, she listened to both tapes and said she could so identify with the author. She thanked me profusely for this gift and said she was going to listen to it in her car as she drove. Her husband has only been dead a month as of this writing, and neither of us expects her to ""heal"" in record time, but she found comfort in this book and made me so glad this is the one I chose to send her.  Based on her comments, I strongly recommend it to the grieving, especially widows"
631,book,"This is a great guide that I recommend to all of you who are looking for scholarships. Check this out thoroughly, and if you feel you're up to the total scholarship plus being paid for training that West Point offers, I recommend that you then go on to read ""West Point: Character Leadership Education..."" by Norman Thomas Remick to understand the importance of this college that is the best kept secret and the one that everyone has a good chance of getting into"

633,book,"Tobias writes a bible in personal financial investment without the lack of humor and personal touch. He is clear on investing principles he preaches, states his opinions precisely and still provide overviews of investments he believes are pure baloney.American investors would be thrilled that he goes indepth with certain investments and terms but international readers might skip 30% of this book that deals with investment products, policies and law regarding the subject in US"
634,book,This is the only investment book I can get my husband to read.  I gave copies of the 1987 edition to my sons when they graduated from college and I am giving them the 2005 edition as they approach 40.  Tobias has been consistent with his advice over the years.  He does not promise to make you rich but he gives guidelines for ending up with a comfortable retirement; partly by getting one to acknowledge what one does not know.He helps create a saving mind set.  His explanations are clear and useful even for more sohpsticated investors than I am.  Plus I enjoy his sense of humor which makes for an enjoyable read
635,book,I can honestly say this book changed my life by opening my eyes on how investing and money really work over the long term
636,book,"I have found the advice in this book to be invaluable.  You simply can't go wrong.  Those looking for a book with stock/mutual fund investing howtos should keep looking however.  This is a broad brush stroke at handling one's money.  Period.  If you are going to read this book, be sure to read My Vast Fortune as well.  The two tell quite a story and show that Mr Tobias is not just blowing air between his gums.  This book is eminently readable and there is just not much wrong with it.  Everything from what to do if you inherit wealth, to what type of life insurance to buy, to how to buy a car, to how to use the internet to save money on staying at a hotel are covered, as well as everything in between.  Read this and prosper"
637,book,"It's clear, easy to understand and remember.  Also entertaining and insightful."
638,book,"First and foremost, Tobias has a keen sense of humor, which makes this book an enjoyment to read.  In my opinion that is the most important thing because if a book is dull albeit with good advice, then you're probably not going to get much from it.  The real-world examples and down-to-earth suggestions make this something for everyone, not just the wealthy.  This was the first investment book that I had ever purchased.  And although it isn't the only one I own, it's the one I refer to most often.  I've never taken a business class, and my career is completely unrelated, but I needed something to help me plan my finances.  I learned an extraordinary about from Tobias and I definitely feel confident going into the investment world.I've since began buying this book for my siblings as a college graduation gift.  I think that you can't go wrong purchasing this item"
639,book,"I enjoy Andrew Tobias' writings.  He is witty, concise and intelligent.  While I don't agree with all of his advice, most of his reasoning stands up. I also highly recommend Tyson's Investing for Dummies, Personal Finance for Dummies and Mutual Funds for DUmmies"
640,book,"I read this book because of I thought it was going to be funny, and it was. But I was not expecting to learn anything new, having read several books on investing. So I got a pleasant surprise when I actually did learn something. I would say this would be a great first investment book to read.BTW, if you are looking for more humorous and worthwhile investment books (a rare thing) out there I would recommend ""Where are the Customers' Yachts?"" and ""The Money Game"
641,book,"The book, ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" is a gross misnomer.  At best, the book should be entitled ""A Good Personal Finance Guide"".  If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed.  The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all.  Way overstated with the title!"

647,book,"This is a story with a happy ending about Liz Sutherland, an attorney, who lost her husband by a gun shot wound. He was killed when a man shot him at their office when he ran an errand on Christmas day. The killer was an abusive and enraged husband of one of their clients. The Sutherlands were family law attorneys and defended domestic abuse cases.Liz and her 5 children grieved for the loss of their father for some time... Not long afterward, her oldest son was severely injured in a car accident. In the midst of her stress along with grief, she noticed a handsome emergency room physician who treated him. His name was Bill Webster, MD. He noticed her also. The two soon began to date... and they began to fall in love.  However, problems arose with Liz's children because not all of them were ready to let go of their father's memory. They did not want to accept Bill. On Thanksgiving Day, when he was invited for dinner, her daughter insulted him. He decided to leave...Liz's heart was broken.."
648,book,"The beginning of the book was excellent and then it tapered off towards the end. The House on Hope St, has tones of her earlier and much superior book ""Accident"", which I highly recommend. Pick it up for a good read, but realize as soon as she enters the relationship with the doctor, everything is textbook romance"
649,book,"This book is a predictable love story, what we've all come to love about Danielle Steel's books. Perhaps we'd like a bit more UNpredictability, but most of the time I enjoy the story anyway. Reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have, that's always a good thing. It also makes you think that if anything bad were to befall you, you could probably survive. This wasn't her best book, but I thought it was decent. If you want to read a really great love story by Steel, check out: The Ring, To Love Again, Summers End, Answered Prayers & Passions Promise"
650,book,"August Escoffier was known as ""The king of chefs and the chef of kings"". This book is indispensible to anyone who is serious about the culinary arts. Escoffier defined the benchmark for classic French cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots, much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music.  You can find essences of classic French cooking in even the lowliest diner fare.Much of what is taught in culinary schools today is based on Escoffier's tecniques.  By purchasing this book, you are getting this information straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak, rather than second-hand with the possibility of influences instilled by the instructor skewing the information.I believe the most surprising section of the book is that dealing with treatments for various types of game.  This section contains comprehensive instructions for dealing with a wide variety of game from buffalo to venison that are very useful today.I have noticed in at least two places, Escoffier appears to contradict himself. I believe this is due to the problems with translation, and if you follow carefully what he is saying, you can figure out the correct meaning"
651,book,"I am very annoyed that people who do not have any idea of what this book is, have the audacity to rate it. If you made the mistake of buying this book thinking it was a cookbook that is your own fault! Please don't rate Escoffiers culinary writings based on your own stupidity.As other reviewers have pointed out this is a reference guide or encyclopedia of French cooking and not a cookbook. The author assumes that you have more than basic knowledge of French cooking and has no glossy pretty pictures. It is complicated yet simple and an is indispensable guide for anybody that wishes to research classic French cooking.To give an example of how this book is arranged, if you wanted to prepare a Velout Alboufera, first you would have to know what a Velout is and how to prepare a basic Velout. Then you would follow the directions to prepare a Velout d' Ecrevisses and finish with a liaison of egg yolks butter and cream. If you don't know that a Velout is a type of soup, skip this book and please please for those of you that made the mistake of buying it, please don't rate it!"
652,book,"It has been said that the true test of any work,whether it be a piece of art, music, or a book is the test of time. This volume has done just that! First written almost 100 years ago these recipes are just as relavent today as they were in Escoffier's time. Please be aware that this book is not for the beginner. The author assumes that the reader has developed the skills and methods that are needed in any kitchen. I have worked professionally as a chef for 25 years and assure you that this work will always be on my bookshelf. When it comes to classic French cuisine this work is indispensible"
653,book,"This is THE book on Classic French Technique and Cuisine by the Master chef, Auguste Escoffier.This the English translation of the 4th Edition of the Guide Culinaire by Cracknell and Kaufmann, and it supersedes translations of the Guide to Modern Cookery (1907).This is the ""real"" English translation with over 5,012 brief recipes for sauces, garnishes, soups, hors d'oeuvres, eggs, fish, poultry, game, garde manger, vegetables, desserts, ice creams and ices...on and on!Don't waste your money on the new abridged versions which have less than 5,000 or less than 3,000 recipes, as you'll be missing thousands of recipes and their commentary, for no good reason!Classic terms are clearly defined and described, and just about any recipe you have heard of in French cooking is here.This is for intermediate level and up cooks and chefs, as unlike conventional cookbooks, a knowlege of cooking is presumed, lest this be far more than than it's 646 pages in length. There are no pictures, none are really needed. Some recipes do make a gallon of sauce, rather than just enough for a couple or foursome to enjoy, so scale back or freeze a lot!Why read it?For me, it's living culinary history, and the recipes can make one drool with their simplicity or lushness...It's the source of thousands of ""tried and true"" recipes, unsullied by ""fusion"" fads or foolishness, where a ""souffle"" defines anything from a pancake to a meringue topping, and even ""molten chocolate brownies"" are also called ""souffles"" by food knowledge-challenged ""writers"" who apparently do not bother to read a recipe, nor have made or tasted a true souffle.I read the name of a tasty dish at a restaurant, and later see how closely it adheres to the recipes of almost a hundred years ago, and surprisingly there's little variation when cooked by a traditional French trained chef. There are many pointers on how to prepare things, unusual combinations to try, how to tie a roast, ... all sorts of tricks of the trade that are passed from one chef to the next, and not found in Joy of Cooking or most celebrity chef recipes.If you are serious about learning and appreciating French cuisine, don't need your hand held while evaluating or following a recipe, and appreciate access to thousands of classic recipes collected in one book, then this is THE source and the book for you"

656,book,The book is probably the best reference I've seen. What it isn't is a cookbook for beginners. I'd recommend it for someone that already knows their way around a kitchen and wants a source for myriad (well only 5100) ideas
657,book,"There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it."
658,book,"Winchester, a geologist and proven writer, is a perfect choice for chronicling the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.  I currently live and work in SF, and enjoyed listening to the book on my mp3 player while commuting in the MUNI subways.  True to form, Winchester only spends a small amount of time on the catastrophic event itself, and instead develops the events which lead up to the event -- first in a geological perspective, and second in a sociological one.Unfortunately, this book does not come together as well as his book on Krakatoa.  Being a current San Franciscan, I found his history of the city lacking.  His conclusions about the current Christian revival as being strongly influenced by the quake is tenuous, but his points about its pyschological impact on society are well-received.The best parts of the books were the descriptions of the science and history of plate tectonics, as well as the detailed historical descriptions of the quake itself.  If you're at all interested in the quake, you should pick this up, and also try his other books"
659,book,"Plate tectontics... yawn... Hey the continents move, we all know that. But what you didn't know is why, what happens with they suddenly move quite quickly. If you live along either the Northern or Southern end of the San Andreas Fault you owe it to yourself to read this book. Lets just say, I won't be living there anytime soon.I liked Simon's other book, ""The Professor and the Madman"" and that book seemed less dry and fragmented than this one. But Krakatoa and the ""Map that changed the world"" are now both on my reading list for the summer. All and all good stuff. The way that history should be taught in High School. (and in this case Geology too."
660,book,A lot of good factual information written in a readable fashion.  I want my family to read this book.  Anyone who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area should read this!  I've already ordered another copy as a gift
661,book,"""A Crack in the Edge of the World"" is a great read that I especially recommend to all whom live, have lived or who have simply just visited the San Francisco region of California.  To all these individuals, it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906.  This book covers that momentous year and much more as well.I had the good fortune of living in San Francisco for two years in the mid 1980s and experienced one relatively small earthquake.  These tremors from below are no laughing matter.  They are terrifying.  One can only guess at the magnitude of the quake of 1906.  Yet Californians are so blasï¿½.  Are they foolhardy or simply ignorant?  I think the former as no one could be unaware of the brittleness of the ground on which they tread.Simon Winchester's book provides the reader with a brief history of plate tectonics, the precise events of 18 April 1906 as well as some ruminations about the future.  He puts this all in perspective and wonderfully entertains the reader along the way.  His analysis of Portola Valley as a ""deeply dangerous place (that is) liable to be destroyed at any moment"" is courageously and provocatively true.  I have visited this town many times and been simply amazed at how people can deny the very obvious fact that there lives rest upon a ticking time bomb.  No doubt his further view that ""many of its houses and offices deserve to be evacuated and abandoned"" will be ignored.  In the long run, he will inevitably be proved prescient.Winchester probably says much that people, particularly those who reside in California, don't want to hear.  However, he is no crackpot.  Rather he is a writer who deserves to be read by a wider audience.  This book is a great work that I recommend to all....and that includes the residents of California."
662,book,"A Crack in the Edge of the World by Simon Winchester is about the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.  This being the centennial of the event, there have been a lot of books produced about it, but I had heard good things about Winchester and his writing, so this is the one I picked.  I'll have to find another one to read that has the info I was looking for.  I was looking for a book filled with stories about the people who lived through it and how it affected their lives.  I wanted to read about families separated and united, romances and businesses.  I wanted to read about human emotion.  This is not the book for that, but that's not to say that it doesn't have merit.  I learned about plate tectonics, the formation of the world, the settlement of the American West, earthquakes in the Midwest, and much more, but only 50-75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in San Francisco, and once the fire it put out, the book quickly ends.  There is a little discussion about the rebuilding, but mostly just to disparage the effort.  Winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of Latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling.  His research is excellent, and I did learn quite a bit, enough to sleep well in my stable state of Wisconsin and ensure that I'll never visit California"
663,book,"Geologist turned journalist Simon Winchester is carving out his own fine niche in popular science writing, of which ""A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906"" is a very good example. However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books ""Krakatoa"" and ""The Map That Changed The World"". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (""From Plate to Shining Plate""), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his ""Annals of the Former World"".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name. However, if you are interested in a sprawling, occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake, then ""A Crack in the Edge of the World"" may indeed be of interest to you, the potential customer and reader"
664,book,"I am always sad to finish one of Mr. Winchester's books; they are definitely not to be read in one sitting and because they stay with you for so long, it is as if you have finished a memorable semester by the time you put the book back on the shelf.  True, they are discursive--but wonderfully so, and ""Crack"" more than most.  Indeed, the cover serves as a hint of things to come--folded into a cover is a surprisingly large poster--just as the ideas of this book are much larger than they first appear.If one truly wishes to understand the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the geological, sociological, historical and other effects that rippled outward in time from the central namesake event, one must prepare for a journey.  As with any great journey, some parts are better and more interesting than others--but the combined and lasting understanding of the science and history to be derived from reading this book is unequalled.  Suffice it to say that upon completion of ""Crack"" the reader understands earthquakes and their impact upon our world.Think of your favorite lecturer in college and you get a sense for Winchester's style--a style wryly self-referenced as bloviation.  His diversions are often entirely unexpected (and not always entirely supportable) but enjoyable and thought-provoking nonetheless.  He communicates a sense of the joy of scholarship and discovery--being able to drive up to Alaska, for example, just to see how the big pipe fared in the massive Denali quake; being able to utterly discredit the worthless dreck rushed into print shortly after the disaster; pointing to that most Californian of attitudes--the stunning failure to take advantage of the opportunity to re-create San Francisco according to a grand master plan, a mistake echoed in Southern California's loss of the redcars in favor of freeways.What Mr. Winchester desperately needs is a format that allows him more graphical content.  Something along the old TimeLife science series or the Dorling Kindersley formats.  Anyone that can work opera, immigration, Arizona's meteor crater, Watson Lake bashing, fault finding (geologic) and roadtrips into an interesting book about earthquakes needs all the resources he can get.  Give the man a series and run him around the world like Michael Palin"
665,book,"With the 100th anniversary of the Great San Francisco Earthquake I eagerly anticipated Winchester's latest book. I highly enjoyed ""The Map that Changed the World"" and ""Krakatoa"" and I expected a similarly great book this time.Winchester again delivers a wonderful narrative on the San Francisco earthquake and the tragedy that befalls the city. A lot of his personal narrative is a bit rambling at times, but the overall theme of the book, the journey across the North American tectonic plate is a good one (though I think John McPhee does it better in his book ""Annals of the Former World""). Winchester again displays an uncanny ability to make the complex (plate tectonics) understandable. I only wished he'd gone into a bit more detail like he did on ""Krakatoa"".Still, I enjoyed the book and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the San Francisco earthquake, and the science behind why it happened then and will happen again"
666,book,"How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding"

669,book,"And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many.It's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions.  This book provoked in me anger, rage, confusion, compassion, sadness, and tears.  I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly.  I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks!I am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones.  Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.Randy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s.  He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.  As far as I can tell, it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community.  Where will the next Randy Shilts, Bill Kraus, and Dr. Gottlieb and the other saviors come from--and will they come soon enough?"
670,book,"Good stories work on several levels; they are multi-dimensional views of the same event. To honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I reread Randy Shilts's groundbreaking work, which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the CDC.It is still an intense and provocative book that reveals the social and political motives that became both pathways and obstacles for finding a cause and a cure for the killer disease. Shilts, who tested positive during the research for his book, but said he didn't ask for the results until his writing was finished, nonetheless brings an emotional bias to his research. His regret (he engaged in many of the risky sexual practices against which he rails) runs like an electric current throughout and gives his story a kind of missionary momentum and zeal.As a result, ""And the Band Played On"" survives as a masterpiece of nonfiction storytelling because it is as much about a human disease as it is about the human condition including themes of betrayal and sacrifice, fear and love, exuberance and panic, loss and redemption - contrasts that the play ""Angels in America"" perfectly captured when it premiered in 1991.Shilts explored AIDS in America as a disease of both body and spirit - seemingly through the prism of his own tragic circumstances. It's a timeless and priceless view."
671,book,To me this important expose on the begining of the AIDS crises and Reagan's response is extremely important.  It's now classic and old information.  But it's a valuable history lesson we all must read
672,book,"The sexual revolution is over, wrote an old revolutionist named P.J. O'Rourke, and the microbes won.  This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war.Author Randy Shilts tells the story of all-night all-day playgrounds on America's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses.  AIDS wasn't the gay plague, Shilts reports.  It was the 4th or 5th gay plague, nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of Stonewall's closet.  Gay sexual activists took it for granted, writes Shilts, that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases.  When the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early 1980s didn't magically appear, sexual athletes did what any normal hot-blooded Americans would do:  they blamed Reagan.Mr. Shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game.  His scorn for bath house behaviors  for blood banks is loud  clear; cheap-shotting of Reagan is muted.  Reagan, after all, had other wars and a rocky post-Carter economy on his hands.  By the time Mr. Shilts' book became a tv mini-movie, however, Reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain.  If only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name, thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved ... after all, we are now told, we all have AIDS.  (Ponder what Reagan might have said if he'd been convinced by Koop or somebody to speak the name of AIDS in 1982 or 1983:  Well, as your mothers probably should have told you ... Reagan, being a realist, understood that AIDS in America was/is overwhelmingly a behavioral disease.)Read And the Band Played On in tandem with Dragon Within the Gates by Stephen Joseph, former health commissioner of New York City and former Clintonista.  These books, together, are the best war reporting of the recent past.  They show how microbes won the war, and how microbes then won civil rights."
673,book,"You want to read a horror story? This is it. This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.EVERYONE ignored it. The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a ""gay disease."" Gay men didn't want to discuss that it ""might"" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldn't even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.By the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease.This book made me cry. The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, ""Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people."" How absolutely disgusting.This is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring. They didn't give up. No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted. Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994. God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US. What the heck is wrong with this country? Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long? What's so stinking WRONG with us?Another book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years. How many people did they kill by doing that? Far, far too many. We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program. This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn't think that was possible.God bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS"
674,book,"Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased. I found myself taking extra time and care in reading ""And The Band Played On"" just to let the information sink in."
675,book,"Having seen the film that this book is based on several times, I was curious to read into the whole story... and this book does not pack any punches.Whilst I did not expect a 'G' rated book, I certianly did not expect some of the in depth writing that is included.  However it is all relevant to the story.Definately a book for our times"
676,book,"The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into ""victimhood"" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer."
677,book,"I was required to read this text for a class.  I would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure.  I found that this text is very attention grabbing, and it is extremly informational.  I would recommend this text to others"
678,book,"Shilts' great book shows us how much of the AIDS related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided. The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not.In between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years.Because the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain.  Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared.Rock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer!But even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind.The bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus.And, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death.Shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's.On the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity."
679,book,I teach practical Game Theory for executives. This book its an excellent complementary material for the course
680,book,"If you are really into learning Microeconomics right form the start, this is the book for you.."
681,book,"I am an unabashed  admirer of Howard Zinn, but I am tremendously impressed with Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation."
682,book,"While I wouldn't recommend that my students read only Paul Johnson's work on US History, I would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts.  Johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the American people/government than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today.  He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears.While I agree that he can be classified as a conservative, I would also note that this is not a ""conservative's conservative"" book.  By that I mean that people who are unabashedly Republican,  Religious Right, etc., will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history.  While Johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures, he does so on a case-by-case basis, always aiming to support his evaluations with fact.  In many instances, these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks.  They are not, however, smelling of the party line.Indeed, Johnson's book is fascinating for his historical scholarship, research, and deep analysis.  His coverage of ""forgotten"" spans of time (i.e. Grant, Arthur, Hayes, Garfield) is welcome, as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage (i.e. Lincoln, JFK).  I found the 1860-1900 chapters to be personally most enlightening.Johnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life.  He is not a social or sociological commentator, which will relieve some of his more liberal readers.  And in fact, I believe most people--liberal or conservatve--would gain an awful lot from his research and presentation if they read with an open mind"
683,book,"Paul Johnson's History of the American People is a great response to Howard Zinn's work. Johnson's offers a conservative take on much of the events and people that Zinn criticizes harshly. The book is a fairly optimistic work, speaking to the resilience and ingenuity of the American people.  I particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the Nixon and Coolidge presidency and his criticisms of JFK. Paul Johnson has an interesting perspective on American history, as he did not learn about as a child growing up in England.  He appproaches American history with a certain zeal not found in other historian's works. I really enjoyed reading the book after reading Zinn's work"
684,book,"I had to read this for a US History class I took in college and when I received it, groaned at the size of the book.  But when I started reading it, I found that I really enjoyed it.  It gives more information than your average history textbook but enough to inspire you to do further research on topics contained within the book.  Its a big one - but very interesting so you won't mind that at all.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I wish that I didn't have to stop and highlight and take notes as I was reading because this could be purely a """"leisurely"" read if you are into history"
685,book,"This is perhaps the best concise history of the United States out there.  Johnson writes beautifully, and, unlike Howard Zinn, he does not let ideology completely dominate the book.  But be prepared to spend a lot of time on this one, as it's a heavyweight"
686,book,"I had to read this book for my college US history class. This is the most interesting history book I have ever read. Besides making a good college text, this book would also be a fun read as it is written like good literature. True he does go on and on about how good the North American weather is, but I say this is only natural for a British Chap :) It is this incredible insight and depth that never gets bogged down that is one of the strong points of the book.A History of the American People reads a bit like Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America in that it is a European that is just fascinated by our experiment in republican self-government"
687,book,"This has been a most surprising opportunity to enjoy the history of our society as seen through the eyes of a British historian.  The author admittedly is a strong admirer of the American people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live.  He supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey.  We are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that I studied going through school in the 1930's and 1940's.  Alas, maybe Washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all."
688,book,"Mr. Johnson brings the history of the United States to life in profound and exciting ways.  I now emerge from four months of reading and intensive cross study with a WELL MARKED copy of this book and a better understanding of our great nation than ever before.  I am already anticipating re-reading certain portions in order to use them in teaching.More than anything this book has helped me to reawaken a passion for history, learning and understanding.  Mr. Johnson's unique voice has become that of an old and wise friend that calls us to take back up the moral imperative that has made this country great.I recommend this book very highly, especially to teachers, ministers, parents and anyone else who has a part in shaping the minds of others.  This is a vital missing link in a complete education"
689,book,"At over 1,000 pages of information, this book looks very intimidating. It's so fascinating, however, and so well constructed, that the pages go by very quickly. Entertaining and highly educational"
690,book,"I really enjoyed this book, in that its not the usual wine and roses type text. He shows America warts and all and I found it most refreshing. Well done"
691,book,"I just reread this book for the second time.  I haven't read it since it came out a few years ago.  I enjoyed it this time around as much as I did the first time.  The book has everything, mystery, romance, humor, and sadness.  It's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end.  The main plot is around Callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on TV.  She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant.  After some investigating and tests, Suzanne is proved correct.  But a baby stealing/selling scheme is uncovered in the process.  Callie is determined to get to the bottom of it.  While that is going on she has to deal with her ex-husband Jake being brought in on her dig, he's an anthropologist. I don't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed, reconciled and explored.  Callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval.  It is a wonderful love story and mystery.  I think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction"
692,book,"The story seems to go on forever. It is a novel after all; a very long one. Each character possesses his/her own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession. The final showdown is worth the reading and waiting. It is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery - who is the person behind all the killings. Romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception. Conveniently, Dr. Dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case - her own. That leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth. The man she never gets over is there to win her heart again. Her brother who she didn't grow up with has his own love interest. A divorced couple find each other once more. Everything boils down to loyalty among friends, lovers, and family members. Not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading"
693,book,"Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read."
694,book,Roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer. This is a gripping story...I was glued to the book till the very end
695,book,"As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another.  Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone.  Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction.  This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger!  Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find."
696,book,"This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. I ADORE this book.  The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating.  Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).  Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot.  It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are"
697,book,"I have been a longtime fan of Robert's work....unfortunately, lately it seems some of the story lines are becoming repetitive. This was refreshingly new and I read it twice before putting it down.There are several different curves thrown into the mix of this book. Everything from Black-market baby selling, to ancient civilizations  their cultures, to theories of ghosts  curses, to dealing with ex-romances in the workplace. Only Roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing.Here is the cliff-notes version: Witty and beautiful archaeologist Callie Dunnbrook, is sent to small town Woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site. Unfortunately, the town isn't that friendly. When people start vanishing, many wonder...could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves? Not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site; but her partner for the dig, sent from the university, is none other than her ex-husband, Jake!! To make matters worse local, famous baker, Suzanne (think-Mrs. Smith's) claims Callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant. Only problem is Callie wasn't adopted...or was she?Poor Callie must decipher clues to the past; Suzanne's, Jake's, the remains in the ground, and her own. As the old adage proves true, secrets never last forever"
698,book,"This book is worth reading if only for his journalistic sections of his personal stay in an abandoned station in the arctic. Also, his section which describes the equipment used is pretty fun to read once you've finished the story.I found sections of The Rifles to be quite monotonous, and the historical thread seems to run a lot thinner here than in dreams 1 and 2."
699,book,"Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like.  It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the ""Rifle-text"", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the ""ages"" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad  twisted ""love story"" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah  Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, ""...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?""  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers  Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful  worthwhile), but here in the most ""modern"" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints  clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which ""voices"" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to  for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later.Next up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt?  From what I understand this will be about the Hopi  Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970's-1980's.  Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip  The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century.  And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians.  Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can't wait - Vollmann's dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various ""Ages"" of our North American continent."
700,book,"I enjoyed reading the Rifles quite a bit.  That being said, it was not quite up to par with the Ice Shirt.  The plight of the native people of Northern Canada (it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves) is not something one usually reads about.  While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the ""great white explorers"" and have little to do with those living there.   I enjoy how Vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters, leaving them to become real humans.  I will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment"
701,book,"Although though it may be hard to begin Vollmann's ""7 Dreams"" series because each book in the series is so massive, it is certainly worth the time. Not only is Vollman attempting to create, with some fiction, the entire history of North America, each volume he writes is a totally new undertaking. New people, names,histories, and unique grammar reflective to  the period. A truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice, Vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears, but since each is complete in itself, that does not matter.  I look forward to his next ""dream."
702,book,"THIS BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME . THE COPY I HAVE IS THE 1932 PRINTING . I KNOW NOW HOW LUCKY I AM TO OWN IT AFTER  FINISHING  . IT WAS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN . OTHER BOOKS I HAVE READ ABOUT HIM DIDN'T TOUCH ON HIS GENTLENESS AND HOW IT AFFECTED NOT ONLY HIS MARRIAGE BUT, THE WAR.  SOMETIMES I THINK NOW, HE WORRIED TOO MUCH ABOUT OTHERS FEELINGS .

703,book,"The storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes.  Americans don't have to.  Abraham Lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness, yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties, which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic.  This book is a labor of love by Mr. Carnegie about his hero; it's his way of making his hero available to us all.  I love particularly the introduction in which Mr. Carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  All the wisdom and insight Mr. Carnegie ever collected in his ""how to"" books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here, because Lincoln exemplified everything that Mr. Carnegie ever taught.  This book is what will keep Mr. Carnegie's name alive, long after his institute has folded and his ""how to"" books have gone out of print.  In this book Mr. Carnegie captures the living reality of Lincoln, his wisdom, his virtues, his beautiful and unfettered English prose, his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind, his deep reverence, and his abiding love.  This is a book that you never finish.  The experience remains with you.  Besides changing forever the way you think about Lincoln, it'll change the way you think about yourself.  This book is not overtly religious, but I'd recommend it alongside Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship, Chesterton's Everlasting Man, and Thomas Merton's Seven-Storey Mountain."
704,book,"If you don't know anything about Lincoln this book is for you!The author, Carnegie, was enthralled with Lincoln and by the end of the book you will be too.The book does an excellent job portraying who Loncoln was from childhood to adult to Presidency. It was the first book I ever read on Lincoln and I ended up learning so much about this superlative man.A great introduction to Lincoln."
705,book,"I agree with Oceandweller who said he/she wished this book were still in print so he/she could send a copy to all his/her friends.  This book is terrific right from page one until the very end.  I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid.  Whatever I paid, it was worth it.  It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining.  Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends.  Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men.  ""With malice towards none and charity for all..."" these, his words, keep echoing in my mind.  Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation.  His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, ""When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion"". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to.  After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them).  This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion."
706,book,"I first read this book in early 1994. It left a lasting impression on me. The account of Abraham Lincoln's life is remarkably written by Dale Carnegie. This is not the story about the Lincoln that we learned about in school. Lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest Presidents. Mr. Carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the White House. We can see the problems that Lincoln had while in the office of President. It would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if Lincoln had not been President because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable. For example, the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made Lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in Political Science or just wants to know more about the President. This is a very interesting book that I found hard to put down. I have read this many times and I cherish each moment that I spend reading the book"
707,book,"All I can say is, if you really want to get most out of your life, and wish to be able to tell your friends and family you had a great life at your last day, you should read this book"
708,book,"I recieved this book (which is ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and ""How to Stop Worrying and Start Living"" in one edition) as a gift from a Dale Carnegie Instructor (Thanks again Ron!). This has been quite possible the greatest gift anyone has given me. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody. Reading this book will increase your confidence and your skills incredibly. Not reading it would be a punishment to yourself, and you deserve better"
709,book,"A lost love he mourned for his whole life, an extremely difficult wife, endless attempts to undermine his authority, constant personal sorrow - who knew?  This book helped me understand and admire Lincoln the man, versus Lincoln the President.  They are both likable characters"
710,book,"This is a thoroughly engrossing book. I could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother's collection of old books. It inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that I do. This book talks about the Lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes. I was impressed with the fact that Lincoln totally despised slavery. Especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers. His triumphs and failures make him seem much more human. Not only was he a great President, but a great human being as well. It illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain. If you can get your hands on this book, it is a must read"
711,book,"It is a superbly written book about one of the greatest leaders that mankind has known. It is amazing how Lincoln, from humble origins, shaped up to become so great. He is an insipiration to all. I only wish that this book was in print - I would send it to several of my friends"
712,book,"I have been a manager for over 10 years, and have worked in different industries and different countries.  And I gladly admit I still have a lot to learn concerning management.  This book talks about concepts we know we should all be applying, such as learning from mistakes, responsibility and organization, attention to details as well as to a master plan, communication, etc.  However understanding how Churchill put these concepts to work is fascinating.  I did not know that much about Churchill in the first place, perhaps that is why I enjoyed the book so much.  It is a nice change from CEOs' biographies.  And yes, I am putting some of what I read to work, so it was worth my time and money"
713,book,"I just completed this book yesterday and I must confess if it was any longer I might not have.  While it was mildly entertaining, it contains little that is new or particularly informative.  The book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in Churchill's life.  Many of the comparisons seem strained.  In fact, comparing Churchill's almost single-handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition, seems inappropriate and a little silly.      It's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business, or otherwise. These kernals are relatively simple and (it seems to me) obvious.  It begs the question, Why, exactly, do we need a book such as this?       The people most apt to pick-up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for Churchill.  If so, those people will likely have read books which are more informative, historically significant, insightful and generally worthwhile.  If this is your first introduction to Churchill, do not let it be your last.  Overall, I think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time"
714,book,"As a longtime fan of Churchill, and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment, the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading. Well it was but only from the 'fan' position. The author sets out with good  intentions and early in the book he relates Churchill ways back into the  context of today's executive's environment. But, by the middle, and then  thereafter, he's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no  real relevance to application to today's leadership 'student'. At times Mr  Hayward really is squeezing the pips to show Winston as a model to follow -  I've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary hasn't  picked up on the idea. If you want to understand Churchill it's a good  read. If it's leadership you want you'll have to browse further"
715,book,"I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book.  It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his ""executive success in the face of adversity."" And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is  like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of  time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized  and a bad judge of character.  In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill  into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been  disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that  Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend  Lincoln On Leadership"
716,book,"As we all know too well, in the flow of flotsam from academe, there is seldom material that is both readable and edifying.  Often neither quality is present. This book, Churchill on Leadership, scores high in both  categories.  Hayward's obvious in depth knowledge of Churchill and his  times enabled him to organize the vast storehouse of material available  into a useful and unique way of teaching the leadership principles  Churchill personified.  God knows the lak of leadership today evidences the  extreme need for what Hayward has wrought"
717,book,"Churchill's leadership and perseverance carry this book. The lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial - as if summing up Churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims.  What Mr Hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us (women included). I learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work (I too can work on my short-comings); he had many failures, some fatal for a politician, but continued to soldier on (I too can persevere); he stuck with his own sense of self-worth when every one else proclaimed him as finished (I too can maintain confidence against adversity).  The maxims, Mr Hayward, are not needed. But thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth, where we can all learn from his extraordinary life"
718,book,"Steven Hayward places Churchill's experience and approach to executive problem solving into historical context.  This is a must read book for students of leadership & management as well as fans of Sir Winston.  A relatively short book about such a significant topic, but well worth the tim"
719,book,"I love these Examples  Explanations books.  The rules make sense when you can get decent examples, and these books do a good job of that.If you find your outline frustrating (Like Emmanuels and/or Gilberts - both of which drive me nuts with frustration) try the Finals series books.  I like them much better as outlines than the ""official outlines."""
720,book,"Great book. Definitely doesn't cover every area of Torts that you're going to need to know for your course (IIED, false imprisonment, etc.). Get Gilberts or Emanuels or just use your class notes on this stuff though. Also: if your professor has a slightly different view on the rules (even if it's just a difference in semantics) use your prof's rules when working the Examples. Writing out your answers to the Examples throughout the semester will solidify your knowledge and you won't have to struggle to memorize the elements of each rule at the end of the semester"
721,book,"The book is great as it is, no doubt, but the older editions do not have Products Liability in them, which is VITAL to your studies. Make sure you get the latest edition, which has two chapters on PL.Aside from that one missing element in the older edition, the rest of the book is excellent."
722,book,This book is very easy to read and allows for easy digestion of complex principles.  I find it to be very useful in understanding torts
723,book,"Very seldom is a sequel better than the original.  Terminator 2 comes to mind, along with perhaps The Empire Strikes Back and the Aliens series.  But for the most part, sequels suck.  The opposite is true in law school support texts.  I borrowed the 2nd edition of this book from a friend and found it to be utter crap (think crap on the level of the third Austin Powers or The Mummy Returns).  It was almost as if Glannon, during a celebration over the success of his Civ Pro E success, got hammered and wrote Torts E 1st and 2nd Eds in a drunken stupor.  It seems, though, that for the 3rd Ed. he either ran out of alcohol or got an editor.  It's still not Civ Pro E, which single handedly rescued me from oblivion (and likely suicide) in that course, but it is definitely worth having"
724,book,For some reason I think Amazon's reviews bleed through different editions.IE. You will find reviews of the 1st/2nd edition on the 3rd editions page. This often misleads and/or distorts the promotion of a product.The newest editions of examples  explanations are fabulous and settle a few issues that may have been present in the past. All to often students expect these to be comprehensive outlines like Emanuels that do all the work for them---no. The grades come to those who work and that is where this series shines. It gives you practice and furthers understanding
725,book,"This book was actually recommended for our Torts class and I am so glad it was. Glannon is a great writer and he makes things easy and fun to read (sometimes he is a little too punny).  His examples are a great help too, especially around exam time.  His practice exams are great at helping you to spot the issues and organize them clearly. Glannon also wrote Examples and Explanations for Civil Pro. That is highly recommended also"
726,book,"Buy this and High Court summaries keyed to your casebook and you're set.  I also used the Gilberts and Sum and Substance 1L tapes while commuting to school--the best preparation with the least effort.  AWESOME!This book make Torts my best 1L subject.  Even though I forgot a lot of details, the substance stayed with me for 1L and it got me an A in Torts.  I'd recommend reading prior to the first year, and then reviewing as you complete each chapter during the semester.  AWESOME especially since Glannon includes a sample exam--good luck trying to find many profs to offer that!An ABSOLUTE MUST for 1L!  You WILL get your money's worth, and if you keep it in good shape you'll find another 1L to buy it from you when you're done with it.  Unless you keep it for Bar Review.This book is like good foreign cars--the resale value stays up. :"
727,book,"as a 14 year old girl spending my entire summer reading this book was possibly the worst thing my teacher could have done to me. i can definately see how some older people could somehow get into it but its really just not that good in my perspective, to me the symbolism made no sense i didnt understand what they were saying most of the time and i'm an honor roll student with straight A's in english. i really deeply and truly do not suggest this book to anyone that is a teenager because it will bore you to death. it did me. pips character was too boring estella was too much of a brat miss havisham was too shrill, the ONLY good part of this book was herbert. he was the only one i liked. my mother loved this book and is now driving me insane with how much she is into it. yes, this book has given Dickens a bad name in my mind although he may not be a bad writer. i can usually somewhat get into english literature but this was just about all i could bear.in a nutshell...its definately a college read."
728,book,"My first complete Dickens book was ""A Tale of Two Cities."" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature"
729,book,Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read.  Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance
730,book,"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as ""important,"" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading"
731,book,"This book has nothing to do with anyone expecting anything great, so I hate it! This book is perhaps one of the greatest books of all time, but I hate it, because the title is misleading. What the Dickens does the author think he's doing giving this book a title like that!"
732,book,"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life.  In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement.  The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House.  The action is more dramatic.  The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing.  The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control.  The humor still abounds.  The language is easier to read but no less descriptive.  No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement"
733,book,"Read it, no matter what, no matter if you have to read a page a day for two years, get into it and you won't be able to put it down and then you'll think, that reviewer was right I love this book. It was the best book that I read in my junior year, it wasn't required reading, BUT IT SHOULD BE! And Miss Havisham and Estella! After reading about the endless virtues of Lucy Manette in a Tale of Two Cities, I found those two very refreshing and intriguing and completely unexpected. Read the book, love the book, accept the book and all of its truths, and then name your cat Pip"
734,book,"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my high school years. Get entertained with Mr. Joe and her violence towards Pip and her husband Mr. Joe Gargery.Also, Pip travels to France to become a gentlemen, which is one of the best parts of this novel."
735,book,"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes.  The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions.  Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen.  Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change.  With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen.  He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe.  truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it"
736,book,"Dickens explores various sides of human nature in Great Expectations, as he tells the story of Pip, a common, lower-class, laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman. Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides. The book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur, how quickly man can turn on his closest friend.A very well written story, Great Expectations continuously keeps the reader interested with its intriguing occurences."
737,book,"This book is well written and very ambitious in its scope.  It is fascinating to get a ""people's eye"" view of the rise of Sun Yat Sen.  Additionally it empathically covers the social response to mixed marriages by two very different cultures.  This is a women orienated book about a very tumultous time and ties the events together skillfully in the Western U.S. and the emerging China of 100 years ago"
738,book,"When I received this book I was really eager to read it. The whole storyline appealed to me and I was convinced, based on the first few chapters, that I would enjoy it.  I'm not sure when I changed my mind.  Maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political China when I just wanted to know more about the main characters.  Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story.  While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side.  I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts.  Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing.  The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable.  To me, that's a deal-breaker"
739,book,"I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. (""Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!"") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are ""right-o, jolly-good"" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK"
740,book,"Using stories told by her Grandfather, Aimee Liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in China.  The story starts in San Francisco at the time of the big quake.  It is a love story of an American girl and a very educated Chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a Chinese person, much less married one.  Her husband is a part of Sun Yet-sen's battle to topple the Manchu Dynasty.  Within the novel is the history of China from the Opium War in 1840 to the Communist's  War of Liberation in 1949.  Good insight into the people of China and their relationship with the Western Powers"

742,book,"While I don't believe that Elizabeth was totally the excellent strategizer, I do believe she was well advised and did her own thinking.  This book goes back and imposing upon historical events the decisions made by Elizabeth-I and how it would apply in business today.  There are certain parallels between a monarchy and corporation that do fit together and can be seen in examples.  The major portion of the book covers the image that Elizabeth set forth by taking on being the  image of the Mother Mary (Catholic church) to her subjects, thus, to make the people more accepting of the new Church of England as the religious seat of power, thus diffusing the Vatican's hold over the people. My only complaint, like others opinions, there were no mention of where things went wrong, only highlighting the good things.  This is a very good book still and I recommend it along with another book called Big Chief Elizabeth (which is more of the history of the new World and Elizabeth's funding of the voyages to capture more land)."

My wife and I kept fighting on who gets to to have the book first, it is one of those books that you hate to leave unfinished. The lessons of Elizabeths leadership are compelling and quite inapiring.I never thought that I would need a book on inspiration in my life, but this book indeed changed this view as well.Excellent work"

Surely, Elizabeth I made a few mistakes like every other monarch, but they fade out in comparison to her achievements. She truly did build an empire, and serves as a great example of a true leader.Tudor schola"
745,book,"Oriana Fallaci died recently and loss will be felt in the Europe that decided to ignore her once she voiced her criticism of it mindless poltical correctness that threatens its very existence. ""The Force Of Reason"" is a call for Europe to wake up and fight back against Islamization.Fallaci knew her time was limited when she wrote this book. In a way, it is to be regretted that not only was she aware of her impending death, but that she decided to do her own English version. Fallaci's English was not up to the task and, as a result, the book is an unnecessarily difficult read which will understandably put many people off.Too bad because Fallaci's message is important. Fallaci correcetly perceives the menace of Islam in Europe. She recognizes the mass migration of Muslims and their refusal to assimilate as an invasion intended to conquer Europe. She laments, loudly and shrilly, the craven cowardice of the politically correct left. What really infuriated Europe's so-called liberals was Fallaci's tracing of their history back through their origins as socialists, fascists and communists. Fallaci distinguishes between the ""left"" of pre-Bolshevik days and the ""left"" that emerged after WWII and predominates in Europe today.Fallaci engages in a lot of self-referential comments, talking about her ""martyrdom"". She was badly treated by the intellectuals in Europe who did not like her message. Her self-pity is understandable, but a distraction.Fallaci's message is simple in the end: ""The decline of intelligence is he decline of Reason . . . Refusing to admit that all Islam is a pond inside which we are drowning, in fact, is against Reason.A""Fallaci provides more than ample evidence of her latter point which proves the former. Many will not appreciate Fallaci's message, but no one will be able to disprove her facts.Jerr"

748,book,"I used to admire this woman.  She was smart.  She inspired me when I was young.  It is a shame, however, to see her intellectual decline in her last years.  Was this the effect cancer had on her brain?  First, I can't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called ""The Force of Reason.""   She appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality.  Second, she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts.  For instance, she quietly forgot the role of Christianity in the Conquest of the Americas and the slaughter of the Indian races.  Or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the European powers.  And what about the survival of Catholicism in Spain in spite of eight centuries  of Muslim domination?  Yes, there were churches and  synagogues in Muslim Spain.  This manifesto doesn't look very different from those fascists wrote about Jews in Europe in the 1930s.   Poor woman."
749,book,"Oriana Fallaci is no longer among the living. We will have to do without her unrelenting opposition to Islamic nihilism.  She died in the United States.  Her fellow Europeans essentially expelled her from the continent.  They made Fallaci's final years a living hell.  As an ex-Catholic, I am more then a little irritated by the Roman Church's capitulation to the radical Muslims.  Fallaci described herself as a Christian atheist and was more of a defender of the ""true faith"" than its own hierarchy!  ""This Catholic Church without which the Islamization of Europe, the degeneration of Europe into Eurabia, could have never have developed. This Catholic Church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted,"" added the author.Fallaci rebukes the politically correct and cowardly European culture which is unwilling to combat Islam's racist, sexist, and homophobic doctrines.  Fallaci quotes Denis Diderot's accurate description of Islam as ""the enemy of reason.""  The anti-intellectualism and contempt for secular learning pervading the religion of Mohammed cannot be disputed.  What has the Muslim world accomplished in the last 400-500 years?  Will its more militant adherents return us to the misery of the 8th Century?   Are there any life affirming moderate Muslims?  If so, where are they?  Oriana Fallaci deserves a statue erected in her honor.  Will her memory encourage us during our inevitable future trials and tribulations?  I strongly believe that this will indeed be the case.David ThomsonFlares into Darknes"
750,book,"""The Force of Reason,"" by the late Oriana Fallaci, is an interesting book which provides criticisms of Islam while exploring the possibility of widespread conquest of Western civilizations and Europe by the Muslims. Apparently, the opposition was not too pleased with ""The Force of Reason"" or her previous publication ""The Rage and the Pride,"" as they have attempted numerous times to have the text banned and Fallaci has also been the proud recipient of numerous threatening messages as a result of this, yet the text has become a bestseller in Europe and, apparently, North America as well, as the book is currently ranked at #8 on this site's bestseller list as of today. She shares some of these ideas with her readers by alluding herself to writer from centuries ago named Master Cecco who, in pursuit of standing up for his beliefs, was thought to be a witch who was later burned at the stake and then the reader is treated to a wealth of information concerning the Troy burnings. Fallaci wastes no time is sharing her views against Islamic terrorists and looks with contempt upon any civilization or religion that does not do everything within the scope of its power to stand up to them"
751,book,This is high octane stuff and not for the faint of heart.  Ms. Fallaci pulls no punches
752,book,"Oriana Fallaci is the Rocky Marciano of Italian letters.  To her, the best defense is a good offense.  If you're pro-Islam you will hate this book.  If you're anti-Islam you will love it.  If you're sitting on the fence you're in for a rough ride.I've never read anything like this book.  The pugnacious Ms. Fallaci picks you right up out of the crowd and drops you in the center of the ring where the fight is taking place.  Her emotionally charged first person style draws you into her mind, heart and soul.  You soon feel you are fighting for your very life, right alongside her.It's been years since I've read a book I just couldn't put down.  Had to take a brief break for some pressing concerns and grabbed the book up again as soon as possible.  Another stint of intense and exhilarating reading, and finally radical Islam was left reeling on the ropes.Winner by a knockout, Champion of Polemical Prose, Ms. Oriana Fallaci.ADDENDUMSept. 18th Obit BLOG by David Horowitz on his website: ""A great warrior is gone - Friday, September 15, 2006 9:21 AM Oriana Fallaci has died after a long struggle with cancer at the age of seventy-seven. Her last years were spent in the United States in part because she was hunted in her own beloved Italy because of her war against the Islamic jihad. A fatwa calling for death was issued an Islamic jihadist; an Italian judge attempted to put her in jail for offending the invaders. She found refuge in the United States. But she also embraced America as her homeland in exile because she understood that America was the global center of resistance to the Islamic threat. The attacks of 9/11 inspired her. From her sick bed she wrote two polemics -- The Rage and The Pride and The Force of Reason which are clarion calls to action to defend the West. If we prevail in this battle to defend our civilization they will be remembered in the same way that Tom Paine's Common Sense is remembered as a summons to Americans to defend their freedom. Orianna Fallaci was a woman of unbelievable courage. We will not see her like again soon. May we honor her by heeding her warnings and dedicating ourselves to the struggle to which she gave her final hours."""
753,book,"This is Ms. Fallaci's forceful reason against the rising and insidious spread of radical Islam into Europe which she refers to as Eurabia. Does she overplay her hand or is she merely telling it as it is?  Are Europe's leaders, especially in her native Italy, biased towards Muslim sympathies in opposition to Christian values?  An argument not likely to be considered by Muslims or their leaders, though the Muslim side should take note that: 1.  opposing and contrary views are inherent to the Western tradition, and 2. many non-Muslims in the West remain skeptical about Muslim claims to be a religion of peace, while their mullahs propagate ingorance and hateful attitudes to non-Muslims; that women are accorded merely partial human rights, depending on the degree of fundamentalist view; and that violent terrorism is an acceptable form of mediating political and social ""grievances"""

For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g.DeliberativeIdeationLearnerAnalyticalIntellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength.If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU."

758,book,"There are thousands of self-help books in the management section of your local bookstore, covering a bewildering spectrum of ideas about how to bring out the best in people. Few of them are helpful, beyond trite statements about human behavior, and even fewer of them are based on more than a modicum of research. Now, Discover Your Strengths is an excellent book on both counts. The Gallup organization has studied excellence in many fields for over thirty years. This book summarizes some of that research from the perspective of identifying and bolstering people's talents.The writers worked hard to make the book clear, precise, and readable. The book never sacrifices clarity, even when faced with complex ideas. I had to read the book twice to make sure that the straightforward writing wasn't masking conceptual problems. It wasn't. The writers lay out the main idea right away; they write that ""to excel in your chosen field and to find lasting satisfaction in doing so, you will need to...become an expert at finding and describing and applying and practicing and refining your strengths."" They go on to describe precisely what they mean by ""strengths,"" then they give you a tool to discover your own strengths by taking an on-line test.The outstanding thing about Now, Discover Your Strengths is the foundation of research that supports it. The Gallup folks are serious about their research. The claims in this book are based on reliable studies of almost 2 million employees. If you have any doubts about their research methods, the writers supply a technical report on the StrengthsFinder tool in an appendix. I almost wet my pants with glee, reading about interrater reliability, modern test theory, and ""big five"" personality factors. All of this is safely ignored in favor of the practical suggestion in the main sections of the book, but it makes a skeptic like me confident in recommending this book to everyone on my team.Here are the main reasons why I recommend this book with no reservations:1) It's based on exhaustive research2) It comes with a free test...a similar tool  would cost hundreds of dollars if you bought it from a career counselor or management consultant.3) It is carefully written and eminently practical.Now, go buy yourself a copy, take the test, and start a strengths revolution at your own workplace"
759,book,"Just when I figured I had seen it all, ""Now Discover Your Strengths"" comes along with a new outlook and a dynamic paradigm. A unique difference from others in its genre is the ""Strengths Finder Profile"" (can be interfaced on the internet).  It covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits.  Chapter 4, page 83, does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four ""themes"" of leadership.If I may paraphrase Vince Lombardi (the legendary football coach): ""In practice I do not worry about what other teams are doing. If we concentrate on what we do best, the game will take care of itself."" I found that philosophy to be the essence of this book.  Focus on your strengths instead of trying to change weaknesses.It is amazing how many companies make this mistake with their employees.  When trying to improve sales, and reduce turnover, they focus on the weakest link (the bottom) when more productivity can be realized by rewarding, emulating, and promoting the best producers.Those who have been obsessed with what is wrong in their lives will discover a better way is to learn what works best for themselves and others. The authors' ideas are motivational, inspirational and can be implemented by anyone.There are some revealing comparisons in the book to another prototype leader (Warren Buffett). Readers will be surprised and infinitely impressed with the key reasons for his success.This book should be a must read for anyone in a leadership position looking to improve the bottom line. It is very well done and has no comparison.  Reading it gave me strength, buy it and discover yours!Reginald V. Johnson, author, ""How To Be Happy, Successful And Rich"""

When you know your strenghts, it's easier to focus on being successful where you are.  If you are concerned about weaknesses, then you are spinning your wheels.  It's like Pareto's Principle.

764,book,"This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.As for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.Your money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10"

767,book,"Being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen I was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor.This book is a great read and certainly we need to understand human nature and include it in our understanding of our history and ourselves today. McElvaine makes a good first stab at this and I will not repeat his argument again but point out a few important errors.The faults with the book concern the biology, both the factual errors and the lack of real exploration. The descriptions of the mating behavior of primates are not fully correct, especially regarding gorillas - the silverback has a very small penis and testicles and little interest in sex except when a female is ovulating which means at intervals of three to four years, hardly comparable to humans. McElvaine also says that animals rarely kill members of their own species but Dian Fossey stated that 25% of gorilla mortality was due to the male gorilla - he kills both other males and infants if he ousts a resident male.The biggest error is that apes are, in fact, not matrilineal. In chimpanzees and bonobos the males remain for life in their natal group and the females leave at puberty. This is most likely the case for hominids and humans ie human females have hardly ever been matilineal and had the benefit of this base for kin or female-female bonding.McElvaine makes a big case for human 'mounting' behavior which may be valid but amongst other primate species there is no universal evidence for it correlating directly with dominance and submission. Sometimes the dominant individual is mounted, sometimes females mount their female 'friends', sometimes a presentation is a way to give an olfactory signal by a dominant. Also, presentations that are submissive are very different from the upright, assertive, four-square stance of a female soliciting a copulation.These errors do not greatly undermine any of the arguments but do show that when we are going to use biology in an argument we need to know more than just a little biology. The fact that human males have nearly always spent their whole life with kin when females have had to join a new group to breed is an enormously important factor in the repression of human females and the dominance of men and masculine values - including men fighting over possession of such females. Looking at primate behavior tends to show that the roots of some of our behavior were very deep and strong well before agriculture came along.Also, even if we do think more about the male/female spectrum of human nature there may well be a number of males at the masculine end of the spectrum who are not striving to be anything other than they naturally are - ie are extreme males who simply have little or no capacity for feminine values. If these are the dangerous males then the best we can do is to stop allowing them and their virtual 100% masculinity to be the role models for the more average male - or even the average human.McElvaine's points about the false metaphors we use,  male-biased language and attitudes, misogyny, a male creator, the belittling of feminine values and behaviors and the impossible way men try to be 'notawoman' are certainly strong and in many ways obvious when pointed out. And it is surely foolish to think that such a lop-sided species can hope for anything other than toppling over in the mightiest of Falls.McElvaine offers a few ideas about how we might be able to overcome our maladaptive proclivities but it is an enormous task both to recognize our human errors and for men to ever overcome their maladaptive inheritance and genuinely not feel so much contempt for the feminine in human nature. It is hard to imagine the necessary changes coming any time soon.A highly recommended read and hopefully it will open up essential further explorations in this area"
768,book,"I liked this book, it definitely gets you thinking about things differently.  I found it very interesting to look at how society and culture changed, including the dynamics between women and men as a result of, or coinciding with the onset of agriculture.I would also highly recommend the book, Guns, Germs and Steel for a look at how society evolves and changes in response to similarities and differences in climate, population, technology.Both these books offer very interesting perspectives, not hum drum at all."
769,book,"This book has been especially useful for a university paper I was working on. It passed some time since that but the concepts I read are still fresh in my memory, since it were concepts I've been suspicious for a long time. One might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male ""impotence"", but if you take an impartial look you'll find he is right. Don't get me wrong: I have no problems in beeing a man, but I'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure, on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman, that he is not a sissy or a gay - wich is even worse -, but, on the contrary, that he is a real macho, a sex machine that can ""score"" as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence. It's sad but it's the reality.Fortunately, things are changing. In Spain we had notice of the first girl (she's 16) that joined a senior male soccer team as an advancee. In Germany, Angela Merkel is the first woman to be nominated chancelor. In the great majority of western countries, the armed forces do accept equally male and female recruits.It reminds me the movie of 007 ""Goldeneye"", when the Admiral said to M (a woman) that she didn't had the ""balls"" to stand in face of the situation, to wich she replied that she had the advantage of not having to be thinking with them all the time...It would be nice if in the future our leaders will think less with the ""balls"" and more with the brains.."
770,book,This is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published. The fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man/woman and the development of societies is indeed sad. McElvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering. His imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy. I guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self-loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership. That's what happened here. Don't waste your time. A disturbing aspect to this is that he's teaching the next generation of leaders
771,book,"This is the book I've been looking for. It explains the world we're living in right now. And where we've been. This book really gets to the root of the basic problem: men arn't able to be men because we're afraid of our femininity. So we're half-men, and we're so [angry] at being half-men that we take it out on women. We blame them for it. That's it in a nutshell. And it all started thousands of years ago, with the agricultural revolution, when we lost our place in society. We were out of a job. And we've been playing catch-up ever since. And still are today: it's still going on. NOTE: I'm writing this on the 10th day of the insane war we're waging on Iraq. After reading this book, you'll understand why these insecure, infantile itiots mask their impotence by waging war. We are at this moment witnessing the catastrophic consequences of the hyper-masculinity that he talks about. As long as we define man as ""not-a-woman,"" we're [stuck."
772,book,This is not one of the better books I have read on history that predates mankind.  Before reading the book I knew that women were the first farmers.  The author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women.  I do not buy the argument

After one quick shuffle through this  book however, we found ourself sitting together and going through the book  as if it were, well what it is, an intriguing history book that accents its  ""flavor"" with numerous recipes, pictures and facts.  Several of  my friends, including my parents and my in-laws will be receiving their own  copy of this wonderful historical treasure. I may even have to buy myself  another copy because my wife likes to dogear pages that she wants to come  back to.  In this case it would have been easier to dogear those that she  did not want to return to"
779,book,"When I started cooking about three years ago, I had absolutely NO experience to draw from (except for grilling and pancakes--the two CAMPING dishes I learned from my Dad).   Because I did not want to give half my  salary to fast food restaurants and eat from stryofoam for the rest of my  life, I decided I ought learned how to cook.  That is when I started  collecting cookbooks. I started with Cooking For Dummies and went on from  there.  I quickly found that I had a knack for cooking and soon came to  enjoy it.  As my cookbook collection grew, I quickly discovered that there  were two types of cookbooks:  Those you cook from and those you read.  This  is the first cookbook that I have found is good for both.  The recipes  included are fabulous and it is a great book to browse.  The recipes come  on all levels so the cooking klutzes and the Julia Childs alike will be  able to use it.  When you buy this book, and you certainly SHOULD buy this  book, go directly to the recipe for blondies.  I had never heard of them  before but they are cheap and easily made.  After I made the first batch, I  made a double batch to take to work where I had just started.  Let's just  say it made breaking the ice in a large office a lot easier.  Thanks, Ms.  Anderson"
780,book,"I've just spent a delightful journey reading Jean Anderson's ""American Century Cookook."" What a treasure, especially for those of us who savoured many of the dishes of this period--but lost the recipes!  Now we have them in an interesting, easy-to-read and-make recipe roundup.  My copy ofJean Anderson's cookbook is tabberd with post-its to preprare  favorite recipes soon--especially Shrimp de Johnghe (page 120) and  StroganoffCasserole (page 151). I hope others will enjoy this cookbook as  much as I. Anne Anderson (no relation!"
781,book,"I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The ""bowel movement"" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book"
782,book,"If you like strange stories, you will love ""Running with Scissors"" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone.Marty WurtzAuthor of Deceptions and Betrayal"
783,book,"How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing.  I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it.  But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did.  I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat."
784,book,"I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up tothe point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore.I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but Ihad to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through"
785,book,"This book is great.  Augusten Burroughs is genius, and a great storyteller!  I couldn't put it down"
786,book,"One of the things I love about James Patterson's books is his prose. It's a no-nonsense, no frills, ""I am what I am"" voice that doesn't try to entice you into the story with a lot of flowery language. In Judge  Jury, the story is written from a first-person perspective: that of FBI Senior Agent Nick Pellisante.  For years, Nick has been on the trail of a powerful Mafia don, named Dominic Cavello, and his efforts are about to pay off.  Nick trails Cavello to the wedding of his favorite niece and successfully captures him.The story picks up the pace after Andie is introduced as one of the jurors selected for the court case against Cavello. Andie is a single mom and an out-of-work actress who is trying to make ends meet with low-paying acting jobs that her agent can get for her.  The suspense heats up when Cavello's people hires a world-renown assassin to help him get out of jail.  The assassin is successful and what follows is a devastating tragedy that forever changes the lives of those involved. Cavello's ruthlessness, however, puts him squarely in the path of an enraged mother who will stop at nothing to get her revenge.Judge  Jury is an easy read but also very entertaining. You'll not be disappointed."
787,book,Great book one of Patterson's best I had a hard time putting it down once I started on it.  Combined some of the legal ease of John Grisham.Really enjoyed reading this book
788,book,"Oh, this was a grabber.  Nothing's missing in this thrill a minute saga - which has been voted ""the book I most enjoyed while staying in Barbara's guest room.""  Two guests now have been up all night reading ""Judge and Jury"".  It's featured prominently on my guest room book shelf with a strong recommendation that if they want to read a good yarn, this is it.  Although everyone reports favorably on the book, it does make for some pretty droopy-eyed siteseeing the next day.  I loved the premise of this one - felt I knew the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip to Ushuaia.  I never knew what the end of the world was like, but now I feel I've been there.  As a writer myself, I marvel at James Patterson's output. I guess if he experiences writer's block, he just says, ""Here, Andrew, you write for a while.""  Whatever the procedure, they hit an ace with this one.  And, what's really great is that while I'm still riding the crest of the wave on Judge and Jury, the news reports another new book about to be launched - ""Cross"".  I can't wait!"
789,book,"Once again, James Patterson has us on the edge of our seats in another page-turner.  He has created a brand new villain equally as detestable as Gary Soneji in the persona of mob boss Dominic Cavello.  When Nicholas Pellisante a/k/a Nicky Smiles joins forces with the sole survivor of a bus carrying the jurors for Cavello's trial which has been bombed by one of Cavello's guns for hire to catch the escaped Cavello, the reader is in for the ride of a lifetime."
790,book,"If you've read other Patterson mysteries and enjoyed them, you'll like this one, too.  There are no real surprises--this novel trods the well-worn mystery formula, but does so entertainingly.  Yes, there are legal bloopers, but people don't read novels like this to learn the law.  If you haven't read any Patterson, you'll probably like this if you like John Grisham, for instance.  These are plot-driven novels with not too much description or fine character development.  If you like Law  Order, you'll probably like this, too"
791,book,"I enjoyed the book, I like the suspense, the connection with the characters, I enjoyed James Patterson suspense novels in the way he writes them and how the characters have their own identity and pesonaility"
792,book,"This book, like most all of James Patterson's books, kept me on the edge of my seat!  I couldn't put it down"
793,book,"An engrossing story well written with twists and turns that make the reader want to turn the page or start the next chapter. I personally found ""JUDGE  JURY"" a more rewarding read than ""BEACH ROAD"""
794,book,"As judge  jury, I would highly recommend this book.  Patterson can't write a bad book, but this is one of his best"
795,book,"The Watcher and Other Stories is a collection of three different but thematically interlinked stories.  I personally thought that the title story was the most intriguing.  The Watcher deals with our protagonist ""watching"" the voting procedures in a home for invalids/deranged/etc.  The home is a mini city and becomes a type of microcosm of Italian society.  Smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution.  The Argentine Ants is a type of mock horror story.  All of the above are extremely well written and executed.  Although I did enjoy this book, I would suggest that readers unfamiliar with Calvino try some of his masterpieces first, and then move onto the minutiae of works such as these."
796,book,"Grisham departs from his usual genre to write a book with a strong sense of place and time (Arkansas, 1950s). The events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young Luke Chandler.The author creates much the same feel that you get from Rawling's The Yearling, though this is not really a coming-of-age story. As you sit on the porch listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, you become one of the family in this book. You hear the local gossip, worry about the uncle in Korea, and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop.The relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant Mexican workers, the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks.I'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify, but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of Luke."
797,book,"While reading A Painted House, I had to keep reminding myself that this was a Grisham book!!  It honestly was not like anything else of his that I've read, and I was happily surprised.The story of a farming family and the workers they take on that summer to help with picking cotton, is one that sweeps you up almost immediately.  The characters are so rich in description and the dialogue so compelling that before you know it you're thrown into the middle of the story that centers around a young boy who is trying his best to interpret the world around him.  In the meantime he's growing up a bit too fast.The conclusion tied the perfect bow on this present of a story.  I'd definitely recommend this book to someone, especially Grisham fans who may have a bit of trepidation in reading something not centered around law."
798,book,"John Steinbeck is one of my favorite all-time authors (The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden).  Grisham has managed to capture Steinbeck's style and weave a tale that captures the reader right from the first paragraph!Luke is a 7 year old farm boy who dreams of leaving the farm and playing baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals.  His family are cotton farmers and every summer they hire a group of ""hill"" people and Mexican migrants to help them pick the year's cotton crop.  The work is grueling (long hours in the hot sun) and Luke must pitch in.  The only respite Luke gets is a trip to town on Saturday afternoons where he can get a coke and see a movie (usually a Gene Autry western or something along that genre).What happens is that the group hired has a scary dangerous man (Hank) who loves to beat up and maim people, a young girl named Talley who likes to charm young Luke and a simple minded boy (I forgot his name) who decides that he will paint Luke's house (it has never been painted in 50 years and thus the title of the book comes from this).Luke is exposed to a good deal of secrets (two murders and the knowledge that his brother who is away fighting in Korea may have gotton a neighboring 15 year old pregnant).The writing is superb and it excellently captures a forgotten time (life on a farm in the early 50's).  I liked this book better than Grisham's courtroom dramas and I hope he has some more of these type of novels up his sleeve"
799,book,"I really enjoyed this book and, not being a Grisham fan (AT ALL), this is really saying something.  I don't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading A Painted House by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found.  And right he was.  This story was touching and fast-paced.  It was enjoyable along the same lines as To Kill a Mockingbird (the only courtroom story I've ever enjoyed) in its background and overall feel.  I didn't like the ending - not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't flow with the rest of the book (a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together) but because it's not the way I wished it would go.  All-in-all a great book and highly recommendable"
800,book,"A Painted House is a truely refreshing departure from the typical Grisham novel.  I do believe Twain would have been pleased.  Sp may parallels (not the least of which is the painting).  Not since The Client (another Grisham favorite) has there been such an engaging juvenile protagonist.  Like some reviews, I found it hard to imagine that Luke was a seven-year-old.  I think any other child that age would have a few more sleepless nights witnessing some of the events in the novel and keeping them secret as long as he does.  But the atmosphere painted by Grisham draws the reader right into the backwater Arkansas area in the hot, humid fields.  Humorous, touching, and above all riveting"
801,book,Fast pace and at times intense.  Kept my interest through the entire book
802,book,"One of those very lovely coming of age stories. This was truly an enjoyable book. It has been 4 or 5 years since I have read it and the characters and unforgettable scenes still linger in my head.Grisham steps out of the box and encircles a world of writing that I would like to see more of from him. This story is supposed to be loosely based on his own upbringing and the passion and honesty of his experiences are transposed into an adventurous tale.I agree with the other reviewer that the boy shouldn't have been 7 years old and more like 10 or 11. (I have 4 boys myself). I think this is the only weak spot in the story. It just isn't convincing enough to me that he is that young, especially in 1952 when a 7 year old was truly a 7 year old"
803,book,"I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton"
804,book,"I realize this is an old title, I've not had a chance to get to all of the back list, I only first read Hiaasen a couple years ago.Anyway, Hiaasen is a writer, pure and simple, but he also has a good idea of what goes on in the human mind and behind closed doors.  That kind of cynicism and satirical writing can be horrible if not handled well, but he pulls it off and I've enjoyed the several titles I've had a chance to read.This one was funny and pointed out some of the absurd things we let happen in our houses of government.  While the story centers around a stripper, it is really a story about corruption and politics.In any case, if you haven't had a chance to check out this author, this is a good a place as any I suppose and I give this one a strong recommendation"
805,book,"The mystery of why every single Carl Hiaasen book hasn't been made into a movie has finally been solved.  Suffice it to say that Mr. Hiaasen should be allowed to slap Demi Moore until her head falls off, and his readers should have the right to go Skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was ""Strip Tease"" the movie.Unbeknownst to stripper Erin Grant, she is at the center of a big cover-up the night one drunk beats up another with a champagne bottle while she's onstage.  The bottle wielder is none other than US Congressman David Dilbeck, who heads the committee that keeps sugar prices artificially high and ensuring fat profits for corporate sugar farmers, who in turn pay their workers disgustingly low wages.   Dilbeck is recognized by one customer who is so infatuated with Erin he offers to blackmail the congressman into helping her get custody of her daughter, which she lost in the divorce because of the job she had to take in order to pay her attorney fees.  When the customer disappears, his body later found by Florida detective Al Garcia while on vacation in Montana, Garcia links the death to a missing attorney and his cousin, who happened to be the fiance of the man who was bludgeoned by Dilbeck with the champagne bottle.  At the same time, the bouncer at Erin's strip club, the Eager Beaver, had been attempting to earn a huge settlement by planting a roach in a carton of yogurt.  His attorney happened to be the same one who went missing.  Erin's ex also goes off the deep end, his drug habit and wheelchair stealing getting out of control as he gets closer and closer to losing it.  There's quite a cast of characters, between the bigshots behind the scenes keeping Dilbeck's career on track to the cast of dancers and crooked managers of both the Eager Beaver and its rival club, the Flesh Farm.  It's great entertainment all the way, which just makes me wonder how the unskilled moron who hacked this book into a screenplay managed to miss it all and come up with the script that made it to the big screen.Maybe I was a little prejudiced because of that awful excuse for a movie, but it took me a few chapters to really get into this book.  Erin was a bit much of a powerless victim at the beginning, but once she gets mad enough to start taking some drastic action, things get going and this wound up being one of my favorite Hiaasen novels.  It's got everything we expect from him:  a convoluted plot full of off-the-wall characters and plenty of laughs.  It even managed to overcome the stigma of sharing a title with the worst movie I have ever seen."
806,book,"I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did"
807,book,"Hiaasen and Dave Barry in the same office...how did anything ever get done at the Miami Herald?Another in a series of entertaining off beat adventures where the quasi anti-social ""good guy"" triumphs over an insensitive self absorbed, environmentally destructive no good-nick"
808,book,"I just finished reading Strip Tease by Carl Hiaasen. I found his writing to be typical Hiaasen which is to say it is unexpected, sarcastic and witty. In this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past.In this book his protagonist is a young woman, Erin, who loses her job at the FBI because of her husbands felonious past. She then loses her daughter when her husbands past is hidden by the very people sworn to protect her when he is 'hired' as a confidential informant.Erin ends up turning to exotic dancing as it is the only way for her to make the money she needs to fight for her daughters' custody. I found this commentary on society, in particular our views on women's jobs and pay, to very poignant. The only way Erin can make thousands of dollars  is to expose herself to the very men who are judging her to be an unfit mother.Following the theme of previous Hiaasen novels, the antagonists are corrupt and oblivious to the harm they cause to both the environment and their constituents. The descriptions of the misconduct is both intriguing and scary.Hiaasen continues to impress with his sarcastic and witty style. If dark humor is what you fancy, you won't be dissapointed in this outing from one of the best writers in the genre"
809,book,"I would give it an 11 if I could. This book is flawless. From the first page, I was hooked. The characters were the best I had ever read in a novel. Hiaasen's humor was incredible-I found myself laughing often. Even though the movie didn't cover as much ground as the book, I think the movie was much better than most people have let on. READ THIS BOOK-you will love it. I have gone through 3 copies, I've read it so much.[..."
810,book,Recomendations for setting up a new kitchen good.  The rest is poo
811,book,"Great book. Easy to read. Perfect for the beginner cook. Spiral bound so it's easy to fold the pages back. Would be nice to have some sort of menu planner, for example buy the ingredients for one dinner and some of those can be used the next day for lunch or another dinner so I dont have a box of 11 eggs left over. I could dig and find another recipe that calls for eggs too but I'm a begginer cook - I need someone to point me to the next recipe"
812,book,"This book is a good cookbook for poor, mac and cheese eating college students. The receipes are easy to follow and cheap to make. The only thing I didn't like about it was that is was too short...more receipes please"
813,book,"As Jean Patterson's sister, I was the target audience for this book. Since I was a college student with little to no experience in the kitchen, I needed help. Scrambled eggs were a nightmare, and macaroni and cheese from the box was as good as got.After testing recipes that my sister sent me I discovered that the directions were not only easy to follow, but the results were incredible. My brownies have even been praised as the best ever tasted. Yes, even better than Grandma's. I find with this book I am eating much healthier, and saving money as well.This book did wonders. Plus it makes a great gift for students!"
814,book,"These recipes are quite simple and perhaps someone who is an experienced chef might not like them, but I am a singleton who works 60 hours per week and this book is full of quick dinners, and more importantly, stuff that I can make and take to work to reheat for lunch"
815,book,"I don't know about college students, but I do know that I'm not sure how I've made it 33 years in life without this book.  The great thing about this cookbook is, the meals don't take 5 hours to prepare, and it's all very simple--almost as fast and easy as calling up the pizza delivery guy, and a helluva lot healthier.  I even impressed my new fiance. ;"
816,book,"I wish somebody had given this book to me when I left the nest. It covers all the basics and would have saved me a lot of calls to Mom. Everything is organized so well, with what you need listed at the top of the page and careful, step-by-step instructions below. The spiral cover makes it easy to set it down on the countertop and not worry about it flipping over to another page. The perfect gift for a graduate"

818,book,This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word
819,book,"Interesting and insightful. However it can occasionally lack clarity, lose the thread of what is being said. Even so, this is well worth snapping up for a summer read. Especially so if you have not read this kind of stuff before"
820,book,"To paraphrase from preface's the famous Dr. Noam Chomsky's (a personal hero) suggestion regarding our ignorance, we do not have any idea  how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved.  I have read this book the year it first came out (1997) and many times over since; should one still belive that thoughts, feelings, beliefs, meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood?  Dr. Pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we ,I mean any non-psychologist, take for granted every day.  I use my mind every day.  (My wife and co-workers might want to argue otherwise, but they are wrong!  I do think on a daily basis.).  Yet I don't have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain.  Is the 17 th century French philiospher Rene Descart right when he proclaimed ""I think therefore I am?""  What insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since Descart's time?  Another words, do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind?  Dr. Pinker, now at Harvard and a gaint in this field, do not have the answers.  As a matter of fact, he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true.  However, he has painted an overall picture on the state-of-art research on cognition.  Oh, the book.  It has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried (I think and hope) to tickle readers' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs.  For example, under the standard equipment chapter, rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind.  He used the working definition of intlliegence (ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one's action to reach that point) to illustrate that we use our desires (ie the latest big screen Sony TV) and use our beliefs (ie if I work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income) to increase the chance of achieving that result (i.e. watching the Final Four basketball games on SONY big screen TV).   Yet is this stimluli (vivid and beautiful live college hoops on TV) and response (working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income) due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input?  Do we endlessly shop for junks we cannot possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all?  Perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere knee-jerk response to stimuli.  What about the molecular/celluar level of the brain?  Can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work?  From page 99, Dr. Pinker stated from the mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts that neurons have one purpose in life: ""add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded.""  Are you joking me?  With a description like this, it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron.  Suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level, as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness (my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks) that might be more important than any single cell.  Another words, perhaps thoghts, ideas, imagination, emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these ""supercomputer"" networking.  This conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless.  What about complexity itself?  Can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival?  It is beyond imagination of my limited mind (no pun intended) that perhaps I don't have adequate brain power to understand my mind?  So why should I or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way?  A mental life is the result of my mind, and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases.  Why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space?  Is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings?  Why can I be peaceful and happy like I want to be every time I am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in Los Angeles?  Dr. Pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish.  He only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas.  I keep this book close to me at an arm's reach every time my mind fails me (more frequent than I like now days and I am only 36 years old) and I re-read it over and over for its shear beauty, audacity, and clarity.  Unquestion the authorative guide to my or any one's mind"
821,book,"Have you been amazed by the things your body can do(and probably cannot do) ... like the great stereo vision, the spatial hearing capability, the ease at which we learn/speak/update multiple languages. How does our brain achieve all this? How does our brain stores and incorporates new information? Where do human emotions come from? What is the reason behind anger, fear and other multitudes of human emotions? What is this thing called consciousness? What is the reason behind the peculiar male, female behaviour? What makes our ties to blood relations so strong? Why we find enjoyment in Art? What is life ... Why do we exist?I personally have been intrigued by these and more of these questions. Most of the time we relegate answers to these questions to some divine entity and many of them we just take for granted. However, this is one of the books that attempts to answer or shares insights to answers to some of these questions. In short this book is going to blow your mind away(literally  figuratively). This book not only tries to enlighten us but also makes us ask more questions about our own existence. In general author contends that the evolution process contributed towards the development of different faculties. In affect we own most of our cool faculties to survival instinct of our genes. The author(a great scientist) provides some interesting evidences to support his thinking.One thing I liked about this book is that it is written in a very simple and easy to comprehend language. It avoids references to tongue twisting weird words like Myelography, Parietal, Occipital. Another thing I liked about this book is that it conveys lots of nice information/know-how via the means of references to interesting anecdotes from Calvin and Hobbes, Godfather and like.All in all this is a must, must read ... it is going to leave your awe-struck!-Sachi"
822,book,"As a layman (even athough I was trained as an engineer), I was quite ambivalent when faced with the ultimate purchase decision for this book, especially after I have read most of the editorial  readers' reviews on the net. I was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author  his book. My decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick - over 600 pages -  the apparent level of complexity, judging from my random five-finger test.However my deep personal interest in understanding brain science  the curiosity streak in me finally drove me to buy the book.The first half was quite an easy ride for me as the author offered a general model to explain how  why the mind works the way it does. This is despite the fact that the writing was dry  monotonous in most areas, witty  crisp in some areas  cram packed with seemingly irrelevant information. The second half was a tough ride for me as the author touched on the implications of social behaviours.Frankly, I am not disappointed by the book even though I am still puzzled by some parts of the book. My own personal assessment of the book is that it is an intellectual smorgasbord of disparate, multi-disciplinary scientific topics/facts (e.g. natural selection, artificial intelligence, neural networks, economics, biology, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, family values, feminism, emotions, etc.) which probably make my reading somewhat difficult, especially towards the second half of the book.At the end, I have really enjoyed reading this book, particularly in terms of what I am looking for in the first place. I also like the author's extensive notes and large reading lists.The most productive learning experience for me is a better understanding (may be I should say another perspective) of visual perception. In fact, in Chapter 4, the author has dedicated an almost entire chapter (from page 214 to 242) to the perception of random-dot sterograms (or 3D visual illusions).  As far as I know, this is the only brain book (after discounting Bela Julesz's book) that I have come across that touches on this wonderful topic, which also happens to be one of my pet subjects.On the whole,  from my personal perspective, this somewhat wonderful book definitely gives a reasonably good coverage on the intricacies  idiosyncracies of the human mind, in spite of what the author had admitted in the preface: ""First, we don't understand how the mind works..."""

824,book,"After becoming thoroughly jaded by the 'standard social science model', and the brow beating of religion, this book was a near epiphany for myself.  The writing is crisp, witty, lucid, and provocative.  I contented myself with how he substantiated his research, albeit there is a sense of having completely arrived with a comprhensive overview of the human mind and subsequent behavior.  I'm sure there is more to be discovered and scrutinized, but the genie is out of the bottle now, and one is compelled to relentlessly and tenaciously pursue this endeavor after reading this book.  Pinker will bring you under this compulsion, if not absolutely convincingly but if only to fan the flames of inquiry.  Dare to read, dare to change, dare to think.  For some, Pinker will open up a 'Pandora's box', but he will leave you with a cautious optimism as well.  This read will stike you like Dorothy stepping into color for the first time.  This book is now permanently shelved for future reference, which is very telling, because I simply can't say that about the vast majority of material I've read to this date"

826,book,"I first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection. From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole.So the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and Family Values rather than the workings of the human mind, though these sections are also a very good read.Having read widely since, I know there is far more that needs to be understood. Particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women, like myself, who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male.Also, with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male.It is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species, though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male.Pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters, sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them, which naturally overrides female mate choice. He is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another.In this book Pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'The Blank Slate' when he writes about rape.Though I now know enough to be able to question points in this book, I still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone."

This book explains how thought leads to attitude leads to action leads to habit leads to character which leads to destiny.  It is my belief that this simple but powerful truth is one of the most overlooked principles in the world.  This book is literally a gold mine of awesome aphorisms and quotes including one of the greatest statements of all time: ""Men do not attract what they are but that which they are"".

833,book,"1. Discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you.`As A Man Thinketh' by James Allen encompasses the idea that ""All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts."" James Allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that ""In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man's weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own and not another man's."" Before reading the book I was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience. I have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to, though I was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create? After reading this book I felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective. I felt as though I had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life, slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture. A world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance I could begin to experiment to see just what exactly I can create. This same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress.Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.As each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent. ""Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results."" Mentally reviewing past experiences I can see and understand the correlation between thoughts I had chosen to entertain and my circumstances. Looking at my present situation I can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality I see before me. At an ever increasing pace I am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present, my future and my past. The more I practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way.Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to ""drift"" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.Reading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives. Through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody. If there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created.2. Can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships, your beliefs, your goals, your values, etc? Explain.Since reading As A Man Thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me, as I can, to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions. Embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society. I believe this would push us all in a more positive direction. I can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework, frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box. If our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking. If we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality, and even learn to positively influence reality, then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking. My goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision I see of a world that works for everybody into a reality.Reading `As a Man Thinketh' helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet, which is that there is no such thing as chance. Looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined. I do, however, think we co-create every situation in our lives through our thinking. Our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we don't pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the `chance' concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience. Realizing I have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life. The idea to me makes life in my mind fair. At least for the experiences I can vouch for.When I read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and I had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences. About three years ago, just before I left England, I fell out with my best friend Huw who I had been friends with for ten years. One weekend in the summer of '02 after I had just come back from a holiday with Huw and some of our other friends. In the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place. The crux of the story is that Huw decided to take somebody else's word over mine with regards to a then recent situation. The information Huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being. At first the situation seemed like a chance happening and I was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about, having arisen from decisions based on what I knew to be a fabrication. I felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary. I really didn't understand how such a situation could have come about. Could it be that sometimes life was unfair? For days I was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts, searching for the cause of the situation. I started with thinking that the person who had lied to Huw was to blame and that Huw had had issues anyway. I came to various conclusions, however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over. This stirred more confusion in me as it was something I did not wish to believe. After really stepping out of the picture, leaving the country for Cambodia, which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life, and then thinking about my relationship with Huw retrospectively I came to see that just as 'Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.' life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship. I asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant. If I had been a good enough friend to Huw then trust would have gone without question. I had lost the trust and faith of a friend. The deterioration of my relationship with Huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where I was forced to pay attention. The situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important. It wasn't anything to do with one situation. I had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues I should have paid attention to, until finally it was right in my face and I had to pay attention.A man does not come to the alms-house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force. The criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity, its strength and weakness.3. What are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book? Please Explain.One of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances.After reading As a Man Thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it's supposed to, indeed quite perfectly, and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules. James Allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way.If there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer? My understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer, it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow. It is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind, body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another. I believe we all have what I can at best describe as a magical force inside us. Ever seen starwars? I feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force, or whether it controls us. Where does cancer come from? I think we create it. I think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to... and through our neglect of certain areas of our life, that we cause such a thing as cancer, and indeed everything else, to manifest.We all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good, or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse. I think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness. I think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world - all the conflicts of the world, or the cancers of the world, so to speak. Take for example the conflict in Iraq or the Israeli situation, the problems in South Asia... I believe it's all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us. We are in control... you, me... everybody. And we all have blood on our hands.Paul Sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become. There is no fixed human nature, no predestination, no God that determines our course. And we suffer because we cannot handle this burden.The power to think, feel, express, believe, will, do and progress is, from the start, all within our hands. This is an extremely dangerous distribution of power, and on some level we all know it. As a result, most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to off-load that responsibility.And we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity. Life in orthodoxy is comfortable, familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency. We sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment.The world around us is an extension of the world inside of us. When we do wrong, we are only doing it to ourselves. I think our whole world has got cancer... and it could even look as thought it's dying, although I hope its getting better. If you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them, our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it.Thinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully. Ever since reading As A Man Thinketh I've been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality. I think As a Man Thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race. The more I think about it the more it makes sense.4. Has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way? If so, explain how?This book has entirely changed my thinking and now I look at life from a totally different standpoint, one where I can see how I am in complete control of my circumstances. Now when I look at seemingly problematic situations I ask myself why and how I have created the situation and I ask what can be learned from the situation. Reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended, I think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody. Why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened? If we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us, no matter what they are.I now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts I allow myself to entertain. Oftentimes I am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from, but now when I find myself thinking something less than constructive I stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling.He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it"

Start with this book to learn how to control your thoughts and create your life"
835,book,"The concepts are not new and hardly new-age. There are no new ideas in this book, Mr Allan was just the first to present them is all. James Allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book. He states in the book ""He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little. He who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly."" Effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book. James Allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure."
836,book,"Okay, it's a collection of Far Side comics, which is what I want, so it's awesome for that reason.  BUT, the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing.  First, all the comics are black and white.  Yeah, it's not about the art and you don't miss much without color, but come on, would a little color kill anyone (especially ones that were originally color)?  Second, it's pretty thin on strips, with 4 to a page most of the time (a good amount) sometimes 2 on a page, and even occassionally one comic on a single page!  It looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page."
837,book,"Some of my earliest memories are filled with reading The Far Side on my father's lap after the evening meal.  Whenever I asked my parents for a one of the standard collections, they told me to wait, one day they would all be in one book.  Then, for Christmas one year, I got this book.What can I say, but thank you Mom and Dad and thank you Mr. Larson!  The Far Side was, and still is, funny, original, and timeless.  This collection gives you some of the best of the original strips and lends itself well to watching the progression of humor up and through until the end"
838,book,"Gary Larson never ceases to amaze me. I've been a religious follower of The Far Side for as long as I can remember. I love the way he looks at the lighter side of life, yet some of the comics really hit home. My favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark! Go Larry - you're my super hero"
839,book,"LOL!!!!This is one brilliantly funny comic strip from one brilliantly sick (in a good way) mind. The Far Side is timeless. I laugh every time I read them, and that's a good thing."
840,book,"How Gary Larson keeps coming up with this stuff I have no idea.  It seems like the more I read, the more I begin to laugh.  This particular Gallery is totally hilarious.  If you don't get the humor in ""The Far Side"", my guess is your brain is wired for something different than reading books. In fact, I heard the current President hasn't got a Far Side chuckle since 1991."
841,book,"The Far Side is my favorite comic, out of all. It is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard. Larson's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on, comparing the picture to the caption, and it is hysterical. There are scizophrenic kangaroos, plane driving sheep, duck relays, and pretty much any other twisted idea out there.ANY Far Side book is one that will never fail to please."
842,book,"Sick, absurd humor is Larson's specialty, and in this collection, Larson is at his best. Many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species, where animals get their revenge on humans. Others are based on themes from popular culture, such as Tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling Kemosabe that the music is starting. They are funny, but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram. If you are a fan of Larson's unique brand of humor, then you will love this collection."
843,book,"""Why not write a cartoon book that doesn't bother with a main character and where each joke is totally different from the next?!"" That must have been similar to what Gary asked himself when starting to write his hilarious comic books. Every joke is truly different from the next one! And every joke is refreshingly original! Each joke comes from a thoughtful, clever and of course playful mind"

846,book,"This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is ""deus ex machina"" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever"
847,book,"It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something."
848,book,"Intriguing as always, exciting from the first page, strong for the first 2/3rds and less ""editorializing"" than usual, but it's just not as good as his higher concept novels. But it's still very enjoyable all the way through, and as always makes you think. It feels a little dated now, but I re-read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Sphere should definitely be a part of any Crichton fan's library. Skip the movie, though. Here, the science is less ""convincing"" than in Jurrassic Park (which is mostly convincing, but stretched) and Prey (which is better writing and fun, but not convincing). But that doesn't matter, because Crichton can write an adventure like few others (as long as character isn't important--character's here take backseat to concept and science). Pace, as always is good. More a rollicking adventure than ""something to think about"" (typical of later novels) and quite enjoyable on that level. It's the kind of novel you'll tear through in a weekend at most.  And that's a good thing"
849,book,"I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier.

851,book,"This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this."
852,book,This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. It turned me into a Crichton fanatic. I have since read all of his books. He creates suspense like no one else. Forget the movie.M.C. is notorious for ending chapters with such a cliffhanger you feel compelled to read on.

856,book,"Bryan Garner brings clarity and insight to the confounding world of legal writing.  ""Legal Writing in Plain English"" contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney.  Some of these are obvious (e.g., use a readable typeface), while others are more nuanced (e.g., delete perhaps the legal drafter's favorite legalism, ""provided that"").  Each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal -- be a good writer so that your reader doesn't have to work so darn hard to understand you.As everyone knows, a simple manual of rules can be maddeningly dull and preachy.  Garner has enlivened his book by including a number of practical exercises so that the reader can put these guidelines into practice before the next memo or brief.  These exercises range from ""basic"" to ""advanced,"" and are well worth the time.After reading this book (and attending Mr. Garner's one-day seminar), I submit that this book should be required reading for every One-L and associate."
857,book,"Bryan A. Garner is leading what might be a Quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear, clean, unambiguous and even interesting prose.  This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage.  The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong.  He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it.  If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn't get to a judge.  They'd likely settle.  And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were ""traditionally drafted.""  And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause.  That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople.  The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language.  Legal writing is written in English, the same English used to buy groceries, talk lovingly to your spouse, and complain to the doctor about what ails you.  There is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson, other than lawyers' need to feel like they're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana.  And the writer's praise of ""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary"" as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement:  ""DESPITE anything in this agreement to the contrary . . . .""  Garner is a brilliant, insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use.  We know what happens with legalese:  litigation and contention and noncomprehension.  Give plain English a try, with Garner as your guide to Aquinas's trinity of wholeness, harmony, radiance, and of course clarity clarity clarity"
858,book,"EXCELLENT BOOK, ALSO MODERN LEGAL USAGE, 2ND EDITION.  ENOUGH SAID"
859,book,"Yikes! There is no longer anywhere to hide, and there are no more excuses. This book shows you how to drop the jargon, the gobbledygook, the archaisms, and the fluff. So your writing is exposed. Now you must think--and write--clearly, and Legal Writing in Plain English will help. Lawyers and law students have needed this book for a long time. It's superb. (From back cover."
860,book,"Typical Danielle Steel fluff, but one of her better books. A little of everything: love, betrayal, tragedy, and hope."
861,book,"What I love most about Danielle Steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character, and this one is no different.  She has had, in my opinion, some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her"
862,book,"I usually don't even browse through a DS book. For some reason I bought and read this one. I couldn't put it down, could hardly stand to take a break to sleep. I did cheer for Deanna  Cried my eyes out over Pilar, even though her character in the book was totally unlovable. I did get frustrated in the end with Deanna and her reasoning behind not contacting Ben about the baby. The visual descriptions make you feel like you're really there. I liked the fact that Danielle and Ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and didn't play games about their feelings. The ending is a let down though. The epilogue should have been set a few years down the road. I loved it when Marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor editing and the not-so-great ending.  Would reccomend"
863,book,I loved this story!!!  The action is fast-paced and the romance sizzles!  Buy this one a nd then buy a few copies for friends they will be glad you did!!
864,book,"I enjoyed this book very much. I'm surprised that this one wasn't made into a TV-Movie (i.e. Once in a Lifetime, The Ring, No Greater Love, Fine Things), but I still liked it. Deanna was very realistic. She was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart, and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter, Pilar, who died as a result of a motorcycle accident. She met Ben Thompson and found fullfillment with him; Marc-Edouard was already having an affair with a woman named Chantal. I thought that he was a jerk for doing that to Deanna. But when it was all said and done and when I finished reading the book, Deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was Ben's. At last she could have a happy life with someone. Keep up the good work, Danielle!"
865,book,"I really really hate that she uses the same names in a lot of her books.  It drives me insane.  She is always using, Grace, Liz, Andrew..but dont get me wrong, I love danielle steel's books more that anything, but come one, can we just get a little insee weensee bit more creative and think of some different names for her books? please?  Im sure that other danielle steel readers will feel the same"
866,book,"This is the first Danielle Steele book I've read and it will definitely not be my last.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  By the time I got to chapter 25, I was wishing that I could read faster because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen.  I was torn between 5 and 4 stars.  I chose 5 stars because it has been 2 weeks since I finished the book and I'm still thinking about it.  Why I even entertained 4 stars is because the characters committed adultery.  From the very begining you can tell that this was going to happen and I didn't like that betrayal was involved.  As I continued to read the book, I fell in love with Ben.  It took a while to like Deanna because an affair is still an affair but I enventually started to feel for her.  Overall, I recommend this to anyone who likes a good love story"
867,book,Whether you like Sandy Weil or not is not the issue here. This is just a fascinating book and one of the best books I have read in a while. You will not regret the time that you spend reading this
868,book,"This book could be considered a corner stone foundation marker in understanding what makes people relevant, even when they are not.Sandy Weill shows how consistentcy and planning directed to delivering real value for others will result in producing positive results. Monica Langley describes well how a strong basis in fundamental value wins over adversity and fills in a vacume.The book does a good job in reflecting the transition from family to business and the process of creating an icon that Sandy Weill became with his challenges as a broker, American Express, Travelers and Citibank. As a reader, you can see how these companies needed Sandy's pivotal instincts to solve their problems and evolve."
869,book,"As a person used to work in Wall Street and live now in China, I read the Chinese version of this book. It was as if I lived, breathed, angered, and cheered with Weill, Dimon, Prince.... One of the best books about wall street of past 10 years. I ordered this book in English and will read it again, for at least once"
870,book,"The top business journalists in the world are the ones that research and pen the groundbreaking Page A1 stories in The Wall Street Journal.  The Journal breaks these stories over and over again, and other news organizations simply trail in their wake.  Monica Langley is one of these trailblazers.  In 'Tearing Down the Walls,' she expands upon a lengthy Page A1 profile she had written about Sandy Weill and details his Horatio Alger story.The title refers to how Weill ""had torn down one wall after another - barriers based on religion, class, even the law - to get to where he was.""  The cover blurbs refer to this book as 'riveting' (Forbes) and 'rollicking' (The Economist).  That seems close to impossible for a business book, but 'Walls' is a well-written tale of a larger-than-life character.  You'll blast through these 438 pages effortlessly.It's also worth noting that based on Langley's reporting, Chuck Prince earned his stripes and was duly rewarded in getting tabbed as Weill's successor.  And, Bank One (and now Chase) made a great choice in naming Jamie Dimon as its CEO.  Dimon leaps off the page as the Crown Prince of Wall Street. Langley is clearly taken with the guy's obvious charisma and skills (Dimon seems to have this effect on everyone throughout the course of the book)."
871,book,"""Tearing Down the Walls"" charts the ascent of Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill, from lowly brokerage clerk to master of a globe-straddling financial empire.  What emerges is a picture of a man who is fiercely ambitious and terrifyingly astute - but  also seriously flawed.Prone to fits of rage, Weill regularly unleashes streams of expletives on petrified subordinates, sometimes reducing them to tears.  He is quick to punish close lieutenants foolish enough to evince the slightest bit of disloyalty.  And his laser-like focus on cost-cutting tends to sow disaffection among employees.But he is also something of an enigma.  Despite his fearsome temper, he has a tremendous capacity for empathy, often moved to tears upon learning of the plight of others.  Shy and unassertive in his early days, he later metamorphoses into a self-assured and forceful leader.Langley is a skilled raconteur and her silken prose is a pleasure to read.  Her ability to glean the finer details of Weill's life is also impressive.  Without a doubt, this is one of the best business books of the year"
872,book,"The author could have done much more with her subject.  Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character.  For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive.  At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet.  Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly?  Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual.  But the author never treats him as such.In the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter's of Weill's life and career.  To sew the articles together into a coherent story, the author suggests that Weill's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the WASPy Wall Street powerbrokers who won't let a Jew join their club.  Perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven Weill for the past 40 years.  But it raises interesting questions that the author doesn't address.I'm a Jew in finance and Jews have been very well-represented on Wall Street for some time now.  Weill is presented as having been driven to create Citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the WASPy Wall Street club.  But by this point we're into the nineties and any exclusive WASPy club had long since been abolished.  So all of a sudden Weill comes off as pathologically insecure, which is intriguing.  But the author doesn't elaborate.This is a good book if you want a run down of Sandy Weill's career.  No other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place.  But all that information confirms that Weill himself is a very complex man; to do her complex subject justice, the author would have had to do much more with this book"
873,book,This is a very good book.  Very inspiring.  Langley is successfull in making a very human Sandy Weill
874,book,"Monica Langley follows Sandford Weill, a shy Jewish boy from Brooklyn, through his youthful struggles against adversity, his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success. Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We recommended Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative"
875,book,I listened to this tape while I was recovering from a back injury. The  meditation uses guided visualization and deep breathing to help focus on  whatever part of your body suffers from pain. I found it very helpful - it  decreased my pain and helped me calm down in general. I would recommend it  to anyone with chronic pain or muscular injuries
876,book,"I really enjoyed this book by Nora Roberts.  It is set in the Carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer, IMHO.  It has romance, treasure hunting, and a little magic....really great!  I liked it alot"
877,book,"This has got to be my all time favorite book...I could not put it down....I read it several years ago...The Scenery, mystery, romance all intertwined makes for a great novel."
878,book,"This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure. You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars!"
879,book,"I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars"
880,book,"With the chilly season setting in here in Washington State, the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long.  I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there.  This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader.This book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun.  How exciting!  The plot was wonderful, the characters were likable, the villians were nasty.  This is one book that I am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat, and I will read it again when the cold starts setting in, so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure."
881,book,"I am fairly new to Nora Roberts.  But this book is not only my favorite by her, it's one my favorite books altogether.  It was so well written it made me feel like I were diving and hunting treasures myself!  And it has such a sweet, romantic storyline.  I was really sorry to see it end.  I hope there will be a sequel.  I recommend any woman to read this book, whether you like romance novels or not"
882,book,"First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read"
883,book,"I can't say enough good things about THE REEF! It shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men, and a strong sensitive male that isn't afraid to dream.This is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter and their families. The families run into each other while treasure-hunting for Angelique's Curse - a treasure that has eluded everyone, and many think it is only a myth. But this artifact is worth everything to some, even worth killing another.As this joint expedition continues, it holds all of the elements needed for a great story: mystery, romance, secrets that can't be shared, deceptions and threats. There are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader isn't sure which avenue Nora Roberts will take until she delivers them to it. This always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and gives you a first hand ""view"" of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue.I highly recommend THE REEF and only wish it would have continued - or at least had a sequel in the works! Great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning. One of Nora Roberts better works!"
884,book,"This book is good, but not exactly what I wanted.  I received these books in excellent condition and in a timely fashion.Thank you"
885,book,"This update is aces!  The added information on pregnancy/lactation safety came just in time (I had just started the L rotation).  The Quick Look-up feature is very helpful!  Overall, this Drug Guide is a MUST for nursing students and licensed nurses"
886,book,"While working as an office RN I am often asked by a patient questions about the ""new"" medication they are on.  This book provides the answers.  It's easy to read, each drug is broken into quick to find sections and it is very up-to-date.  Don't practice nursing without this book"
887,book,This is one of the best drug guides I have found. It contains everything you need and then some. It also has a handy cd-rom with tons of information on it.
888,book,"This book is very helpful.  It has lots of drugs in it, and a lot of valuable info for planning patient care and ensuring there are no medication reactions"
889,book,"This excellent package comes with both the hardcopy and digital PDA version of Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses, the best drug guide which I have used.How many errors could be alleviated if more nurses looked up their meds?! However, since on most units, medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases, the sad fact is that meds are not looked up. My first PDA drug guide was Mosby's, which I have had for over a year; I now also own Davis's. I cannot tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages, adverse reactions, or nursing considerations. More than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result, but had I not been in the room, the med likely would have been given. How nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket, searchable by both generic and brand names (no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name), always accessible.So now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a PDA drug guide, but which one should you buy. Like I said, I have owned Mosby's Drug Guide for over a year and have just recently purchased Davis. I have found Davis's drug guide to be more thorough. Davis is also easier to navigate. Both Davis and Mosby have drop-down menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the med-entry (i.e. mechanism of action, adverse reactions/side effects, compatibility, nursing considerations, client education, etc); however since Davis has the content divided into more subsections, it is quicker to navigate to the desired content. So, my personal choice is Davis; however I do not think you would be remiss to purchase either of these. I only encourage you to move out of the hard-copy med-book and to the PDA version.You may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides (such as Pagana  Pagana's Diagnostic Laboratory Test Reference, ISBN 0323033954; or the one included in Medical-Surgical Nursing Clinical Companion, ISBN 0323031994), medical dictionaries (Like Taber's, ISBN 080361408X), and more. I hope that more nurses are walking around with entire reference libraries in their pockets resulting in better practice, improved patient outcomes, and reduced errors.http://www.hantla.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=20"
890,book,"For the first time, I ordered my school texts on-line to save money... I am so pleased with the results. Shipment was fast, product was perfect and I saved money. Great for a ""forever"" student"
891,book,"You can't go wrong with this fantastic drug guide! It is listed under generic names but if you don't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name.  I had a nurse/lawyer professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all.  This book delivered it ALL: classification, pregnancy catagory, indications, mechanism of action, contraindications and precautions, adverse reactions and side effects, interactions, route and dosage, availability, nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses! Also implementation, patient/family teaching and evaluation.  Wow! I've been very impressed.  It came through for me so I didn't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something! Davis's Drug Guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including: recent drug approvals, additional drugs, combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that  include class, indications, adverse reactions and side effects, route and dosage and contraindications and warnings.  Appendix E  is about natural/herbal products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book.  There are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites, formulas helpful for calculating doses, routine pediatric and adult immunizations,  recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs, schedules of controlled substances, food sources for specific nutrients (ie foods rich in K, Na, Ca, Fe, vit K, vit D, low Na, foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine), and insulin and insulin therapy.  Also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past.  The organized, easily found references in this guide could save your client's lives.  Just because a doctor orders it doesn't mean it is ok to give, as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all! Highly recommended! Good luck all future nurses!Soar!"
892,book,The book I received was in good condition. It had a minor crease on the cover were it had been opened.  Overall I would buy from this seller again
893,book,"I got this book when I started nursing school in 2003. This year (Fall 2005) as a senior, I wanted to get an updated drug guide, so I asked my Adult II instructor what she recommended, and purchased it. It was from another company, and was in shrink wrap, so I did not look at it before I purchased. The company is very reputable, but I found that the layout and content of the book not as extensive as Davis's. That was $35 down the tubes! I would like to see a newer editon of Davis's that covers the many new drugs. As soon as I do, I will purchase"
894,book,"Bill Rancic, the dashing winner of the first season of  Donald Trump's runaway-hit reality show The Apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book You're Hired: How to Succeed in Business and Life that he never went to business school and that he doesn't believe that business theory can be learned from a book.  What then is the affable Mr. Rancic doing offering advice on good and  ethical business practices?  Making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame, that's what.  In two hundred pages, he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215,000 applicants to become the Donald's first `Apprentice.'  The reader is privy to Mr. Rancic's early entrepreneurial efforts, businesses that whet his appetite for something larger.  Readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition.  Through it all, Rancic recounts the lessons he's learned, persons he's admired, falls from which he's risen.  He offers opinions on Kwame Jackson, his fellow runner-up to the Apprentice title, and `deceitful' Omarosa, whom many believed was the cause of Jackson's loss.  He also details lessons he's learned on goals, values, strategies, leadership, vision, and success.  While business school grads may scoff at Rancic's straight-shooting and simplistic advice, it is less idealistic than The One Minute Manager series of books.  Here, Rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams.  The result is one that is as memorable, yet as pleasing, as a tall glass of lemonade."
895,book,"This is not the type of book I usually read, but the persona that came through was so engaging that after flipping through a few pages, I decided to buy the book.Rancic personifies the American ideal; wholesome, grounded in a loving family that emphasizes hard work and integrity (and genetically blessed in the looks department!). This fortuitous mix of ""apple pie"" ingrediants have garnered him national fame, and this book outlines his experiences (along with the lessons he learnt along the way) that propelled him to be The Apprentice.The accounts of his experiences are modern day fables, with the moral of the story encapsulated as life lessons at the end of each chapter. In addition, each chapter contains vignettes of wisdom boxed in grey shading. Many of these are commonsense admonitions we've been hearing all our lives to the point that they have become cliches.  Rancic shows that these tried and true maxims of the American dream still apply.I gave the book four stars for two reasons. One, the editing is sloppy. Writing a book in a conversational tone does not override the need for proper grammar. Two, Rancic's references to himself sometimes tend to sound smarmy (as when he refers to himself as ""master chef"" in the pancake story from his childhood and later when he calls himself an eligible bachelor).Somehow, this takes away from his self-characterization as humble. Such relatively minor flaws aside, this is a book worth reading."
896,book,"While lots of books give you high level theories on how to succeed in your business, they usually leave you hanging at the end of the reading not know what actions to take in order to apply the theories in your day-to-day operation. Rancic's book however has a step-by-step recount of how he did it with his cigar business. You will get specific actions that you can do tomorrow to generate sales. While other books give you general directions (and lots of bullsh), Rancic tells you specifically what he had done to succeed his business, what radio station he called, how much he paids for, what's the account was, how much he charged.If you are an entrepreneur starting out or already struggling with your small/medium size business, this book is your road map."
897,book,"If you are looking for a book filled with tactics and ideas, this is not it... move along. If you are looking for an inspirational addition to your business collection, then this should be yours. Personally, I loved this book and read it in one sitting. It profiles Mr. Rancic, demonstrating the obstacles he has overturned on his road to success. ""You're Hired"" shows what can be, and motivates one to achieve"
898,book,"From the moment I picked up this book and started reading it, I could not put it down! Literally. Thank goodness my toddler was still sleeping in the early morning hours, which allowed me to do so. Bill talks about how he was brought up and how is entreprenral mind was formed. It was a very interesting and inspiring read. If you are thinking about going into business for yourself, read this book. It confirms the fact that if you do not go for it, it will never happen. Bill took his dreams and ideas and turned them into reality."
899,book,"I don't so much mind the money I wasted on this book, it's the time that bothers me. Bill Rancic, you're fired"
900,book,"I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself.I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book"
901,book,"Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know.  The show was much better, you should buy that.  Kwame is much smater and deserved the job.  I can tell that this book is another promotional tool.  Don't waste even a cent on this book"
902,book,"I really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series.  If you are a fan of Dean Koontz you will not be disappointed.  I give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in, but well worth the wait.  Whew, what a ride"
903,book,"This character is a very unlikely hero...A total Geek, who is absolutley likeable.The story fast paced and well written..This was my first Koontz book and it will not be my last I'm actually reading ""forever odd"" and that too is very good..Read this book"
904,book,"For me, this was one of starters of Dean Koontz's books. I really liked the book. Dean Koontz is my favorite writers, cause of him I am doing my own book. Pick this one up, really good characters, main character, really good story, and plot"
905,book,"I didn't know what to expect before reading this book, but after reading it, I recommend it to any and everyone.  One of the best I've read of Koontz, and I've read quite a few"
906,book,"Kirk's book is supposedly the bible of Conservatives. Not neo-conservatives, but Conservatives. He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth).After reading this book I had a better understanding of where the Conservatives are coming from, althohgh I still don't understand why an obscure Royalist politician from the 18th century should be their flag bearer. Royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the US, although we seem to flirt with it from time to time.Conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy, as we currently have in the US: they would rather rely on accidents of birth, cronyism and college organizations to select administrators, rather than people who have succeeded in other venues. A very informative, albeit frightening, book."
907,book,"This book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking. It is not very difficult to go online and read any number of Conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day. But, this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of Conservative intellectuals. Often times it is portrayed (not without some merit) that Conservatives are anti-intellectual. I have frequently heard that Liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual. But, The Conservative Mind blows a hole through all of that. Kirk examines major Conservative thinkers like: Edmund Burke, John Adams, George Canning, Benjamin Disraeli, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, and T. S Eliot (amung many many others).The most difficult aspect of this book is to accept John Randolph and John Calhoun as figures to be celebrated. They both were men who used their talents to protect an evil system of slavery. Although, as another reviewer elquently noted, Kirk was not endnorsing slavery or racism or anything like that. Just the fact that Conservatism is a The ""negation of ideology,"" and that change will happen, in Kirk's prospective Calhoun was only following that line of thinking. I personally don't agree with it that far. As obviously slavery was antithesis of what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution stand for. But, again stating, Kirk is not writing to argue that slavery should not have been eliminated- only that change has to follow the methods of that society.I would recommend this to anyone- Conservative or Liberal. It is a magifnicent study of Conservativism. It can be a little dense at times, but that is to be expected and it shouldn't detour anyone from reading it."
908,book,"The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, ""[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man"".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, ""What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well"" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, ""state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law"". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day."
909,book,"Probably most people reading this already know of this book's reputation and influence, so I'll skip over both the chapter-by-chapter analysis and the praise (I'd end up in what Kirk would call ""overweening"" praise, anyway).  But I do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer.  The caricature to which I refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change.  In fact, the reviewer even argued that the Soviet Union could have been seen as a ""conservative"" system (an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media).Perhaps the reviewer missed or didn't understand Kirk's repeated references to conservatism as the ""negation of ideology.""  An ideologist is anyone who tries to rubber-stamp a system of premade ideas onto a society or culture.  Think of the ""New Soviet Man"" in the Soviet Union.  Think of the ""Cultural Revolution"" in China.  For that matter, although it wasn't imposed militarily, think of the ""Great Society"" in America (it worked out about as well as the first two).The ""negation of ideology,"" then, is the conservative idea that one takes societies as one finds them, and then tries to work out change organically from within those societies, rather than imposing it on them from the top.  (Think of the current liberal infatuation with attempting to rule America through the Supreme Court for a good example of the ""imposing from the top"" model.)  Sometimes this change can be quite radical, radical in the sense of ""getting to the roots"" of something, as in the American Revolution (which Kirk discusses extensively).  The colonists believed that the liberty they already knew was being circumscribed, and fought to extend it.The reviewer also slanders Kirk in implying he would be in favor of accepting slavery.  No, our own Constitution details life and liberty for all, and the organic application of it (as we see in our subsequent history) extends that life and liberty to all.  Even the writers of the Constitution, some of whom owned slaves themselves, knew that the Constitution's principles would lead to freedom for all.  Lincoln (a Republican, let's never forget) certainly knew it.If you really want to know about the intellectual history of conservatism, this book is where to start.  Don't be put off by reviewers whose lack of sympathy for the subject leads them as well to a lack of understanding of the subject."
910,book,"I found Kirk's work to be an excellant antidote to the Religious Right and Neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as ""conservatism"" today. A good place to take back the Conservative philosophy, a philosophy of tolerance, respect, fairness, and progress, from the extremists bent on Right wing ""Christian"" tyranny"
911,book,"Kirk starts off with 6 basic tendencies that define conservatism.  Among them:Pessimism.  Conservatives do not trust human beings to seek the good.  We believe human beings are concupiscent, and that government, as an institution made up of concupiscent human beings, is untrustworthy and corrupt.  A liberal believes human beings are essentially good.  Modern ""liberalism,"" aka socialism, having failed to prove any of its theories as to where evil comes from, has turned cynical.  There is a difference between healthy pessimism and cynicism.Anyway, Kirk begins by outlining 6 key points of conservative thought (which are forgotten by our current liberal Republican president).  Then he discusses the major thinkers who defined conservatism from the late 18th to early 20th centuries"
912,book,This was by far the most informational book I have ever read on conservatism. I learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism. Also this book is very practicle and worthwhile. No hype just fact and purpose. Anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking.To those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book. It is a book that should not be taken lightly. The very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. A must have in every library. It is in mine
913,book,What a charming story! This book is a perfect quick read for an adult over a cup of hot cocoa........or a great adventure for a young girl. It beckons to those who enjoyed The Secret Garden or Isle of The Blue Dolphins. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone wanting a good clean adventure into an old fashioned fantasy world.
914,book,This story is exactly what it is supposed to be - a good story for KIDS. I don't seem to recall JK Rowling saying anything about it having a single thing to do with Harry Potter - she loved the book as a child. Had she said she loved Green Eggs and Ham someone would inevitably launch into why the flying Ford Anglia was based on the blue car Sam I Am drove up a tree. Give it a chance and form your own opinion
915,book,"I just found out about this book as an adult, read it and loved it.  I wish I had heard about it as a preteen or teenager -- it was exactly the type of book I read as a child.  While it does have magical elements, it is not full of ""Harry Potter"" magic if people are lead here by JK Rowling's comments.  It is more fanciful and mysterious, with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in -- a perfect escape from the real world for a bit.  It sounds like a movie is being made, which intrigues me.  I can't wait to see how it translates to the big screen.  Altogether, it was an absolutely lovely book, one I am going to recommend to others to read -- 'tween, teen, or adult"
916,book,"After reading some negative reviews of this book, I needed to buy and read it myself.  I couldn't believe that if the story was so bad, they would be making a movie of it.I believe that this is a charming ""old-fashioned fantasy"" ... nothing more, so why make it anything else?  Let children read and enjoy the story.  After all, it is not meant to entertain adults.Silver horses, magic, and peculiar circustances don't need to alarm the children who read the book or see the movie.  I, for one, am anxious to see how this story is transformed for the screen.  I will let my imagination run free with the little white horse, and simply enjoy the movie as pure and delightful amusement.I recommend this book for children to enjoy and anticipate the plot as the storyline develops.  Their imagine will soar!"
917,book,"Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one"
918,book,"My mother read me this book nearly 30 years ago.  I remember being totally drawn in by the magic: Maria's special room with the star ceiling, the big cat who turns out to be a lion...  so wonderful for a budding brain.  All children should read it"
919,book,"I recently purchased a new copy of this book. I read it years ago, in 7th grade.  I enjoyed the book the second time and I'm glad I have it for my future children to read someday.  The story is a pretty heartwarming one.  Everyone gets along pretty well and there really isn't too much unhappiness in it.  Everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt.  This is mainly a story about learning to compromise.  I would recommend this book for children (primarily girls, since the main character is a girl) ages 10-13.  Younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them.  It's a nice story for adults too, for the child within.  It's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a ""dog"", and the unicorn as just a ""little white horse"".  I must say that I prefer the picture on the cover of the first book I read.  It was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn.  I think that one was much prettier than the current cover art.Also, a suggestion for parents or teachers...when I originally read this book, it was for a school book report.  Part of the assignment was to create a board game that went along with the book.  It was actually kind of fun, though maybe these days 12 an 13 year olds may not enjoy it as much as I did."
920,book,If blood and gore is your preference do NOT read this book.  It is a simple story with a touch of magic.  I first read it when I was about 12 and have been looking for it ever since.  It has joined my home library for neighborhood children and my grandchildren.
921,book,"I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader."
922,book,"After literally stumbling across Wallace's ""Brief Interviews With Hideous Men,"" I immediately purchased ""Broom Of The System.""Through a series of lough-out-loud dialouge and absurdly detailed passages, the story of young Lenore Beadsmen unfolds before the reader's enchanted eyes. Among the funnier characters, there are Lenore's violently jealous boss who is coincedently her lover; Wang-dang-lang, a friend from college; and Norman Bombardini, an obscenely obese lone-wolf with an unhealthy obsession for Lenore.Although there are really no key plots, the story is never dull and a lot of the short stories within the book (critiqued by none other then Lenore's boss who runs a publishing company) are reason enough alone to buy this paperback edition.Although I think the ending was overly abrupt, it fits in well with the context of the character, especially considering his apparent fixation on ""words"" (the word itself is the word that should appear as the last word in the book, if this made any sense to you whatsoever).Nonetheless, this book is a definite must have for any Wallace fan, and an excellent introduction to him which will not give you a workout every time you pick it up to read like the hefty ""Infinite Jest"" undoubtedly will.blog.myspace.com/mattyp24"
923,book,"I hate DFW. I love DFW. And so it goes. This appears to be the tenor of the reviews as well as the general reaction that David Foster Wallaces writing seems to induce. I became interested in reading the late 20th century ""greats"" and began with Infinite Jest. One hundred pages later, I was sufficiently confused and decided to back off and read some early or shorter works by my authors of interest. Thus, I read Delillo's Body Artist and DFWs Broom of the System. Despite the fact that DFW is clearly more intelligent than me, I managed to finish the Broom of the System. It is more approachable than Infinite Jest, funny, and entertaining. If you are new to DFW, I would say that this book has a similar ""feel"" as the films The Royal Tenenbaums or I Heart Huckabees.  Is this a perfect book? No. Is the writing outstanding? Yes - but not completely perfected. Is the plot compelling? No - then The Historian and DaVinci Code are compelling but thats all they offer. What is it that makes this book worth 4 stars? It is simply DFWs ability to capture the irony and lassitude that characterized the youth zeitgeist of the late 20th century. He does this with humor and zest that are rarely matched. It may be DFWs lack of driving plot that makes people so frustrated. However, recall that the ""Greatest American Novel,"" Moby Dick was panned commercially and critically when first published. Was Melville ahead of the collective curve? Probably. Is DFW also ahead of the curve? Given the equal number of people who dislike or love his writing, it is not unlikely. Either way, The Broom of the System offers an approachable starting point to one of the great writers of our time. March onward, Delillo, Wallace, and Pynchon"
924,book,"This novel provides an interesting angle for fans of David Foster Wallace- a great book, but clearly the product of a fascinating and inventive writer who is still figuring out the true extent of his voice. Thus, while the book has many of the hallmarks of his writing (the ""must....describe....everything"" of his subsequent works), it also has a kind of- dare we say- brevity, that is refreshing and works in the book's favor. While it stops short of the brilliance that followed, this is still a wonderful book, full of amazing characters, amazing situations, and is just plain an amazing read"
925,book,"There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know ""what happened"". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting"
926,book,One of the best non-fiction books available on the subject of what is really happening in America. Recommended reading for those over the age of 18 thhat truly wants to understand what is happening to our country
927,book,With William Cooper now dead killed in a shooting. I feel it shows he was right trying to pass on this information. He gave his life so we would know the truth.
928,book,"Alot of folks love to criticize Bill Cooper. I personally think he was reporting truths from his experiences  information he got his hands on.  He claims right up front that some info may not be accurate.  He NEVER claims to be 100% accurate, and gives you his sources for the info, not just opinions.  He took a stand to expose secret information he felt the public should know.  Whether you agree with him or not, you've got to respect the man. He fought to get this book published  ultimately lost his life holding on to that ""stand"".  It's risk-takers like him that gives us knowledge  information to see hidden truths.  Thank you  God Bless you, Bill.  Rest in Peace."
929,book,"This book is not for those who wish to continue living their monotonous and stressful lifestyles. This is meant to make you aware and to further draw your own conclusions.  Critical thinkers only!!Also, this is for the reviewer Robert, from jacksonvile, Florida.  You stated that you know the 'truth' about William Coopers death... uhhm  were you there?  No, all you did was research on the internet and all of a sudden these truths emerged from the files revealing cooper's death.  You stated that he was shot and killed by deputies (like the govt.) for resisting arrest.  Right, okay then.  Aparently, you did not extract any information from this book and you are a waste of life.  Watch these movies:  The Island, The Matrix, V for Vendetta  and countless others"
930,book,"It's not too difficult to understand how ""Behold a Pale Horse"" has become ""the best selling underground book of all time""(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental ""Tragedy and Hope"".)To all the ""if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!"" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show ""Alien Nation"" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow ""fringe"" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to ""Pale Horse"". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that ""Behold a Pale Horse"" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible."
931,book,"There is some who would say that Bill is a right wing gun waving nutcase like one reviewer below. But I just think he/she/it is a liberal dupe. There is also lots and I mean lots of conservative dupes. I'd say Bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather. To dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong. There is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination. Their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the Federal Reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts. Do your homework and you'll see the crash of 29' was no accident. The IRS is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers. Now I don't know about the Illuminati  or Skull and Bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected. This book covers it all. Not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface. This is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt, slime and worms are. As for Bill's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first. Theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this. Either way this book is a good and informative read."
932,book,and every american should read this book then pass it on to bush his friends and family members
933,book,"Pay no attention to reviews about this book. Read and dicide for yourself what is going on in these 500 pages of mind boggling information. You can't really take the book as proven fact, though, as Cooper has mentioned this in a disclaimer in the front of the book, himself.""Behold A Pale Horse"" is really just a collection of information that Cooper had been distributing for many years. He faxed news letters, held public lectures and debates, and dedicated his life and perhaps even his death to revealing the truth about the people that rule our nation, and possibly our world.If he's not ""one of them"", as he states several times in the book, then William Cooper is a true hero.. or puppet, I'm really not sure. The thing that I liked about the book, though, was that he simply proposes several ""conclusions"" through-out the book, based on whatever information he'd found.He attempted to verify everything that he came across, and I think that Cooper honestly felt like he had a real chance at hendering whatever might be coming. However, what affects might this book have had on the world? If you're on a search for truth, this book is the origin of a lot of the information that people will hand you. I couldn't even begin to think about all of the ways that this book, alone, might have inspired people. Heh, or the number of watch lists I could have put myself on for posting this review."
934,book,"Type Cooper's name into Google and learn about what a nut job he really was.  He allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun.  A court issued an arrest warrant.  When two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them.  They returned fire, killing him"
935,book,"A friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right. It is one of the most underrated books out there. It's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old. The real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives. One of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity. Buy it, read it and pass along to your friends and family."
936,book,If you don't have it then buy it.  Everyone should own a copy
937,book,"I recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life, and I'm grateful that I did. It encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type, however it doesn't leave anything out, while addressing each topic in a succinct way. It is not new, and a few of the examples given will be dated. That doesn't lessen it's messages in anyway."
938,book,"Written around 50 years ago this book still holds true. It is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success. Like most 'success' based books the concepts in here won't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple - Think Success and Gain Success. The belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success. Believing you can, will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons, it will find a HOW so you can achieve your goal. Conversely, if you believe you can't, your mind will find reasons to support your claim,The application is always the challenge but this book definitely inspires you to tap into the innate potential within. Coincidentally this book arrived a few days before I had an important job interview and put me in the success frame of mind. I passed the first interview easily, nailed the second one and got the job! It's the sort of book you will read again and again to keep the concepts fresh in your mind. It's also a book you will want to lend people you care about.Highly reccommended. Buy it!"
939,book,"This book has made a huge difference in the way I react, work, play and think about things that come up all the time.  The highlighter flowed throughout and my inner lightbulb glowed regularly when reading this timeless marvel"
940,book,"I am not sure I would have used the word ""Magic"" in the title.  Actually there is no magic in thinking big.  But the results of following the advice given by Dr. Schwartz might seem like magic.The simple truth is that most people have very self-limiting beliefs.  And as a result, think in terms of small achievements.  Change your way of thinking and you change your life.  As Schwartz points out, success is achieved ""by following conscientiously and continuously a plan for self-development and growth.""  And he gives you a plan.The book is well written, full of interesting stories and great advice.  If you implement just a few of the ideas he puts forward, you will make considerable improvement in your life.Some of the more notable bits of wisdom:""We learn nothing from telling.  But there is no limit to what we can learn by asking and listening.""""Others see in us what we see in ourselves.""""People who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people ...""""Before you start out, know where you want to go.""The book contains a wealth of great information and wisdom.  However like any great advice, it is useless unless and until the reader takes action.  For the words to benefit you, you must take action.  A great blueprint for taking action, but taking action is up to the reader."
941,book,"Refreshing audio, letting yourself be open-minded and then relate and apply what you hare to your present situation. This audio cd will is good for those people that are constantly on the go"
942,book,"This book is a classic just like Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich.  The idea is basic and simple; you have to think and believe in yourself to be succesful.  It does not matter what degrees you have if you are not going to think about how to overcome your problems be it social, economical or whatever problem, you must take action. As stated in this book action cures fear. So, If you fear something then do something, and the fear is gone..."
943,book,"I enjoyed this book very much. The author was very clear about her research and the conclusions she reached. It really helps explain the cultural setting of belly dance in Egypt better than any other book I've read, and it's fascinating reading as well due to the little details she tells us about dancers living in Egypt. A must-read book for those interested in Egyptian belly dance"
944,book,Too many books about Oriental/belly/Middle Eastern dance lean toward fantasy rather than scholarship.  Van Nieuwkerk's book explores the seemingly paradoxical love-hate relationship many people have toward Egyptian belly dancing and dancers and  details the history of the dance over the past few centuries
945,book,"While probably not the best handicapping book even from the Beyer set, this is one of the more entertaining handicapping books around.  You should read his earlier stuff first to see how he evolved as a handicapper to incorporate some ideas such as pace, trip, and form cycles, where earlier he had largely dismissed those.  Where I spent a lot of time taking notes from other handicapping books, I spent more time turning pages and just enjoying a good read here"
946,book,"A very well written book. Easy to read, entertaining and full of useful information, this book makes otherwise complex theories easy to follow. The use of anecdotes and real life examples allow for easier understanding of the ideas presented. This is a useful addition to the library of any horseracing fan. The serious student of horse racing handicapping should easily recover several times the price of the book from using the information presented - that is a safe bet"
947,book,"Andrew Beyer is the godfather of speed figures in thoroughbred racing. In preparing to bet the Kentucky Derby and other races this year I read Andrew Beyer's fantastic book ""Beyer on Speed"" and Joe Cardello's book ""Speed to Spare"".  These two books fundamentally changed the way I handicap races. It is simply careless to handicap races without understanding Beyer Speed Ratings and use them to your advantage. This book explains the origins of the Beyer Speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work. I used the information on ""Beyer on Speed"" and ""Speed to Spare"" this year (March, 2005) to hit a big trifecta at Santa Anita - without Beyer Speed ratings and the information they provide, I would have never made the bet I made.Andrew Beyer is not only a great author, but he is at the forefront of making a day at the races enjoyable to all.  ""Beyer on Speed"" is a book that will absolutely make your trip to the track more enjoyable than you can imagine.  Beyer doesn't sugar-coat the various elements that make handicapping a less-than-perfect science, but he does help you understand the fundamentals in a very concise way.I appreciate Andrew Beyer's commitment to racing/handicapping that is so evident in this book and in all his other writings. Andrew Beyer remains at the forefront of the war against doping in racing and other honesty/integrity issues. Andrew Beyer is one of the reasons that horse racing is such a great sport. This book is for anyone wanting to know how to quickly understand the joys and pitfalls of handicapping - and why thorougbred racing is so much fun."
948,book,"This book is not for the beginning handicapper, but has some of the best information in it of any handicapping book I have read. Most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks, but little knowledge is given to the reader. Beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper. I wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days, then show you how they break down the races to make their selections, not with programs they want to sell. It would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track, if they would bet it or pass it"
949,book,"Reading Andrew Beyer is at once informative and entertaining, which anything on handicapping has no excuse not being.  While his first book introduced speed figures, and his second mixed the application of them with an appreciation of other aspects of handicapping, this book revisits the holistic approach - always emphasizing speed figures - in an era when everyone has access to more information than ever, and many even know how to use it.  What makes reading Beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see, vividly, the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches, in the stories - one might call them lessons - he recounts (the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing).  Beyer, like Bill James, is a scientist, and thinks like one, to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides, and making the same old mistakes.  People like Beyer and Steve Davidowitz are largely responsible for the ever-escalating arms race which parimutuel bettors are fighting amongst themselves.  It's a wonderful game, but if you don't want to get left behind, better read this"
950,book,"Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's ""Number One Bestseller"" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a ""bestseller"".The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's ""deep dark secret"" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again..."
951,book,"Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it"
952,book,Faith is a beautiful older woman that puts up with her husband's coldness in their marriage just because she doesn't realize what he's doing to her. She has two daughter's Ellie and Zoe whom mean the world to her. It's not until she decides to go back to law school that her husband begins to treat her worst by the minute. Both of her daughters are no longer at home and it's not until she meets up with a childhood friend Brad that she begins to see what she could have. Coming back from a trip a day early she finds out that her husband has been unfaithful to her and she finds hope for her future in the childhood friend named Brad whom happens to be married. Faith and Brad get closer as time goes by and the rest is a fairytale come true. In my opinion this book was one of  D.S.'s best
953,book,"Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new ""formula"" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all."
954,book,"Wonderful yet so very sad at the same time.  I am a HUGE Danielle Steele fan.  This book, along with all her others are tops"
955,book,"The people in Faith's life are dying or moving away. At her step father's funeral, she sees an old friend she grew up with. Her brother's best friend Brad Patterson. They talk, exchange e-mails. And Brad goes back to San Fransisco.When she gets home she can hear Alex upstairs in their bedroom. She needs to get ready for a dinner party. Alex is a investment banker. He tells Faith to hurry up. In a half an hour she's ready to go. Alex looks at her and thinks she looks like his daughters.Faith has so much time on her hands. One daughter is in London and the other is at Brown. She starts thinking about going back to law school. She knows she has the time, with Alex always gone on business trips, and her daughters away. She has e-mailed Brad several times. He encourages her to go back to school. She brings it up to Alex. And he thinks its a terriable idea. She needs to be home to cook for him and be his wife. Not a full time student at her age. She tells him she needs something to do. ""Learn to play bridge or take a class at the museum"" he tells her. That sounded boring to her. She sends off for brochures from some of the local schools.More e-mails between her and Brad.At Thanksgiving their daughters come home. Everything is going good. Until Alex tells the girls about the ridiculous idea that their mother has about going back to school. Zoe thinks its a great idea.

Alex is in the same mood as when she left. Faith tells Alex what she had seen. He told her it was her fault. And moved out. Can Faith and Alex work things out or do they divorce and fall in love with someone else"
956,book,This book is very good..gives an excellent description of a woman who is in a bad relationship and feels trapped. Interesting how she manages to wiggle free and start her life over again
957,book,"This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them"
958,book,This is the third edition of this book that I own.  As a dual diagnosis counselor I have found this book to be an invaluable resource.  The psychopharmacology of both drugs of abuse and mental health medications are explained in a detailed manner that is very accessible.  I find it a valuable resource in helping me educate clients about drug action
959,book,"A Primer Of Drug Action is a nontechnical guide to the actions, uses and side effects of psychoactive drugs which will prove important for any psychology or health library collection. A Primer Of Drug Action covers everything from herbal applications to clinical treatments of psychological disorders, revealing the latest findings in the applications of drug therapy to various conditions"
960,book,"I first read a friend's copy of this book, which he had used as a text in a psychopharmacology course.  i soon acquired my own copy, and a number of my friends have read it--it's a very accessible introduction to  mind-affecting drugs, with generally good pointers into more specific  literature.     Julien's strengths are in the area of legitimate,  prescription use; i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less  complete.  the chapter on psychedelics is, unfortunately,  nigh-on-useless--errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book.    this book has been an indespensible reference for me"
961,book,"I became aware of this book because it was used as the textbook for a recent upper level biopsychology seminar.  It was one of the best books I have ever had to use for a class, and I believe is an extremely valuable  reference for anyone with interest in the way drugs affect the brain.  The  writing is clear, concise, informative, interesting, and complete.  Each  chapter gives an overview of the family of drugs and then goes into detail  on a few of the most common examples.  Everything from delivery to  half-life to molecular action to side effects is  covered.  Many of my  friends went out and bought the book after looking at my copy to learn  about either their recreational habits or prescription drugs.  A background  in biology would be useful for understanding all of the information, but  there are also appendices which explain the basics"
962,book,"This book offers a great way to approach difficult conversations.  There are several templates in the book to show the reader how to do this.  However, after reading it, it does tend to repeat certain aspects of the material.  I am sure that some of that is for effect; but for someone who is capable of applying material quickly it can be somewhat boring.  I still recommend it as a read, but I do not recommend that you need to completely read the book to get the overall message"
963,book,The information and the examples in the book are easily applied and really do make a difference.  I used the book as a reference working with first line managers; it is especially useful to them in confronting passive aggressive communication styles
964,book,"I kept thinking that this book was about business and wouldn't be applicabable to me, but boy was I wrong.  This is an amazingly insightful book that helped me in every area of my life, business and personal.  Take Susan Scott's advice and apply her suggestions to all areas of your life and you will be living at a much heightened level.  As she states it, it helps you come out from behind yourself and become real"
965,book,"I've just come back to Fierce Conversations for about the tenth time.  Scott has developed the clearest instructions on open, direct communication I've seen in 20+ years of working with clients around communication issues.  She gives easy to understand guidelines and supports each with excellent examples.  Anyone who has been around long enough to have read the early texts on Action Science will appreciate Scott's ability to put complex concepts into understandable action.  This is a must-read for anyone wishing to practice communication at its best"
966,book,"If you've ever wondered about how to have a single conversation that will make a difference, this book will provide the guidance for that conversation.  Scott is quite skilled at creating a simple approach to difficult situations.One caution that I would offer is that this book is not a magic silver bullet.  You have to do some work and actually call upon some courage on your own.  The tools that this book provides is only have the battle.  That which you bring will provide the missing link.There is great value here.  This book is truly a gift that you will find valuable.  I recommend it highly"
967,book,"This is a worthwhile book for personal and leadership development.  It contains practical tools such as:1) The Decision Tree for delegation and professional development2) A confrontation model3) Questions for one-to-ones (fuel for discussion with colleagues and direct reports)4) A Leader's Stump Speech:  Where am I going? Why am I going there? Who is going with me? How will I get there?5) The concept of our ""Emotional Wake"" - worth reading and pondering about. ""An emotional wake is what you remember after I'm gone.  The aftermath, aftertaste, or afterglow.""6) The image of the crucible to remind us that our job is ""simply to hold, so that whatever needs to be said, what needs to be heard, can safely be said and heard.""And much more....There are also many fresh metaphors -- one is tempted to keep highlighting the book.   Rich quotations, references to books, music, poetry.... good examples and stories.I also appreciated the ""Assignments"" and Brief Summaries at the end of each chapter."
968,book,"I bought the book on CD, listened to it, and immediately listened to it a second time.  It contains invaluable information for self-help, business and/or leadership development.  Practical examples that stress the importance of being earnest with yourself and in your day to day discussions.  I assumed from the title this was a book about confrontation - it was not, it was about encouraging (and accepting) honesty and constructive feedback in all your human contact."
969,book,"Susan Scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all ""pretending not to know"".  I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious.One of the topics discussed is called ""Mineral Rights"", a type of conversation designed to get deep, past the surface and into the truth of what is going on.  The approach accomplishes four purposes:  Interrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges, and enrich relationships.  It has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate America, and is rarer still where I work now.  The book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them.  The many questions posed throughout the book, and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace.   The answers usually are ""in the room"" if we can really get honest and start looking for them.In addition to some great business council, much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves.  Often we are the problem, and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie, is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships.  Another great approach used is the ""Decision Tree"" to help build empowerment in others.  Communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others.  (Page 252).  Her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool, both internally and in interactions with others, were right on.While this was all excellent, and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches, what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our ""emotional wake"".  We all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people.  The question is, what kind of wake do we want to leave?  How do we want people to feel?  This served as a great wake up call for me while reading.Overall, this book is so full of great wisdom and insights I couldn't begin to do it justice here.   From the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout, I believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication I have read.  It is both deep and practical, both academically sound and real world tested, and is written in such a way that it felt like a conversation itself.  Highly recommended!"
970,book,"A must read. A possible next target for the US or Israel (check today's news). Let'shope our new Congress is able to make the right decision,after getting the best unbiasedintelligence. They should make sure Scott Ritter (who was very accurate on Iraq. He;snot as knowledgeable on Iran-but who is) is thoroughly involved in their discussions.Before any military action,strenuous efforts at real diplomacy with all the playersin the region are essential"
971,book,"Scott Ritter and Seymour Hersh have made at least two appearances at The New York Society for Ethical Culture in the past year to discuss US foreign policy issues concerning Iraq and more recently Iran.  The October 16, 2006 appearance covered the issues of Mr. Ritter's current book Target Iran.  Transcripts and podcasts are available.It is Mr. Ritter's contention that the Busch administration's primary tool of foreign policy is that of regime change.  Any efforts by those nations that are so targeted to engage us in diplomacy have and will be rebuffed.  This administration will not talk to those it considers it's enemies.  This has been challenged in the media by the James Baker group, but it remains to be seen if they will effect any changes.Target Iran, according to Mr. Ritter, in based on press coverage in the Middle East and private confirmation of those stories by members of our intelligence community.  The story is that America is already working inside Iran with dissidents to identify targets.  We are also said to be negotiating the details of staging areas for our base of attack for this widening of the Middle East war.  Once that is completed, this administration intends to attack.The public is and will be sold the same scenario in which (ala Downing Street memo), the facts will be fixed around the policy.Why will this happen?  One element is the influence of Israel.  Iran is perceived, and not incorrectly, as a major threat to Israel.  But Ritter makes the point that Israeli and American interests are not identical.  After the recent events in Southern Lebanon, watching our congress and our administration give their complete support to whatever Israel was going to do, it's hard to see much separation.Whatever the threat to us from Iran, Mr. Ritter says it's very much overblown at this point and should not lead to war.  Iran, according to Ritter, approached this administration several years ago to normalize relations and limit it's nuclear research.  They were rebuffed.  Mr. Busch can only visualize regime change.If this goes forward as Mr. Hersh and Ritter both seem to think is inevitable, what are the chances of success?  According to these gentlemen, the results will be utter catastrophe.  Iran will immediately shut off the oil spigot.  Venezuela will create a hemispheric crisis by acting in sympathy and fail to honor their US contracts.  US troops in Iraq will be under attack by the Shia and possibly because of a religious fatwa in response to our attack.  Iranian missiles will be directed against the Saudi oil fields to further disrupt the world markets.  The world economy will be plunged into a massive recession.  This could lead to a ground invasion of US troops most likely from Uzbekistan that could easily turn into a trap.  Our ground troops are seriously depleted and under equipped at this point already.  Here is where Ritter says this administration could use field grade nuclear weapons to break the back of Iran.  He thinks this is the ultimate deal breaker because it absolutely assures us that radical Arabs will find a way over time to deliver a nuclear bomb to an American city.These scenarios seem outlandish, except there are so many radical Republican sources cheering on war with Iran, that one cannot expect this administration to not once again respond with a military solution as the first order of business.  Of course, they visualize success not the failure predicted by Ritter.The massive failure of our government during Katrina and the fiasco in Iraq are both symptoms of the same problems in the Busch administration.  What if war with Iran leads to the doomsday scenario that Ritter and Hersh talk about.  This book is a sober assessment of these issues and should be read widely by the public.The potential of a Democratic House of Representatives in the near future will not change the scenario described by Ritter.  American militarism is ascendant.  As Ritter says, if the war in Iraq were going well, the public would be very satisfied.  The fact that the war is against all tenets of international law and was an immoral act on our part is not something that most of us seem to worry about.  Too many Democrats only talk about running a competent war"
972,book,"Scott Ritter provides chapter and verse on how conflict with the Axis of Evil nations could have been avoided with direct negotiation.  The mullahs of Iran sought to negotiate with everything on the table, including nuclear weapons and a treaty with Israel. North Korea still wants direct negotiations.  So did Saddam. We don't negotiate with regimes we want to remove.  Bush prefers to ""take them out"" no matter how many Americans die"
973,book,"This could have been one of the most important books of the year. Scott Ritter provides important, but tangential, information related to Israel's influence over U.S. foreign policy, the history of the IAEA in Iran, and the theory of regime change as the real reason for U.S. ""concern"" over Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure.Unfortunately, Mr. Ritter misses on two counts. First, he offers little direct insight into the Bush administration's policy-making process. And second, someone forgot to edit the book. We are talking about gross grammatical errors, periods in the middle of a sentence, and even a sentence that is punctuated with both a question mark and a period. It is painful to read some of the paragraphs because they are so poorly constructed (at first, I thought my eyes were tired).At least this book attempts to offer something better than the pablum provided by major media and NPR. It does provide some real insights into the workings of the IAEA, Israeli intelligence and exiled leaders-in-waiting who often lead U.S. policy astray.Mr. Ritter is at his best when he stays close to his area of expertise - weapons inspections. This topic requires far more than that"
974,book,"First published in 1999, and its still going selling strong! This manual has a lot going for it.It is a practical step-by-step manual with clear pictures illustrating every posture, with a descriptive teaching of the postures.David covers the basics, intermediate, right through to the full flow with 263 pages of Davids yoga and teachings.I reccomend this book to anyone starting out in yoga, (in particular) because it does give visual learners good pictures to grasp and learn from."
975,book,"This book is the best book on ashtanga yoga on the market - a must have for any person interested in ashtanga yoga. It covers all aspects, showing easier versions of the poses so that the beginner can also follow it.The back of the book has shorter versions of the full primary series so that when you are limited for time, you can do a shorter workout.The only thing about this book that is not so great is that when you have used it for a long time, the edges of the pages start to tear due to the way it has been bound. It has been bound this way so that the pages stay open while you are practising a pose"
976,book,"This was recommended to me by my Ashtanga teacher. It has great photos and really complements what you hear in class. I understand more the drishti (eye gazes) and what the modifications to the poses are. When I think about it, I open it up and read about a particular pose that I am having some trouble with. It's really nice to have around.I do wish it had the Sanskrit counting in it, but that is a minor thing"
977,book,"This book is a fantastic guide for your Ashtanga Yoga. I would recommend reading Yoga Mala (Pattabhi Jois) first, and then using this book as a guide for your practice. Illustrations are clear, vivid and easy to follow. The binding of the book allows for propping while praticing. David Swenson does a fantastic walking through step by step how to get into each pose. I use it everyday"
978,book,"Do you look like this person on the cover? If not, you may want to rethink this book. I got it as a gift but plan on ""regifting"" it soon. It makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people. Interesting Asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it, but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life, not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young Indian boys. For a different view, take a look at ""The Yoga of Heart"" by Mark Whitwell."
979,book,"David Swenson offers an excellent book to support building a personal Ashtanga practice.  I have been doing Ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by David's Primary Series DVD and this book since I first began my practice.For anyone who does not have Ashtanga experience, cannot find a teacher in their area or want to practice outside of a yoga class, David's DVDs are incredible and instructive.  This book is an excellent companion to learn the finer points of the practice at your own pace.This book is also phenomenal for those experienced in Ashtanga who want to create a Mysore practice.  A Mysore practice is a quiet practice.  The only sound is your breath, while you go through the sequence at your own pace.  It's a profound opportunity to ""hear your own voice"" and in my experience, builds a deep inner trust.  Swenson's book not only lets you look at one asana at a time, but it also provides an ""at-a-glance"" sequence for a kind of ""cliff notes"" effect.  This was excellent to have by my mat as a reminder of the sequence while creating my at-home Mysore practice.I have had the great fortune to take a class and teacher training with David Swenson.  He has a down-to-earth style, humor and an incredible knowledge of Ashtanga that shines through in his book and DVDs.  I highly recommend his work to anyone interested in Ashtanga yoga."
980,book,"As an Ashtanga enthusiast, I am always on the look out for new things to add to my collection. My first Ashtanga teacher made copies of this book for me years ago, and I loved those few pages. Now that I have bought the entire book, I see just how wonderful it really is! It explains each posture in both the Primary and Intermediate Series in simple to understand language. Plus, David Swenson includes various modifications for difficult poses, which is always helpful.Also included in this book are a few short practices sequenced togethery by Swenson, lasting 15, 30  45 minutes. These are excellent as well!This is a wonderful Ashtanga book that any yogi or yogini who practices Ashtanga needs to own! Good for all levels - beginner through expert. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
981,book,"I've reviewed most ashtanga books out there,and this is by far the best!!! The fact that it can sit on the floor with the spiral binding is a real bonus to any student or teacher.I really like how Mr. Swenson gives options to many poses giving accessability to everyone that can't stretch like ""Gumby"".Highly Recommended"
982,book,"This is an excellent look at Ashtanga Yoga. Swenson uses good descriptions of the asanas and the vinyasas that link them and his analogies are a creative look at Yoga: Standing Series and Finishing series as bread slices in a sandwich, with the Primary Series as the filling in the sandwich; and the idea of a vinyasa as the ""etch a sketch"" which clears the slate for each new asana, and his ""physics of flight"" and ""ground transportation"" as a means to jumping forward. My only wish for the book would be that it would contain a fold-out page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page. It would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down. Also, (Ok, I have one more wish)I appreciated the break down of the Sanskrit word into meanings, but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too. Otherwise, it is nearly perfect"
983,book,"This book is a classic and David Swenson is well loved by the yoga community. I'll admit that I find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes. (David did the design and layout himself). But, you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import. Overall, I find David's voice friendly, supportive and unassuming. He does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students. This book covers a lot of information, including Primary Series and Intermediate Series.Between owning this book and ""Astanga"" by Jean Hall (0754810747) which has lots of luscious color photos featuring a variety of models, especially Jean Hall,  I have access to a balanced presentation of Astanga."
984,book,"Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know.Alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party.Every election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage.Alterman tells us that ""when it bleeds, it leads"". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on."
985,book,"To ""Hinkle Goldfarb's"" review, I would like to add several observations.Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not?I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative!Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists."
986,book,"Even for the already-converted, this is a great book.  Normally I'm not too sympathetic to lefty books that will cleary be read by a number of conservatives that you could count on your hands and maybe one foot.  But even the choir will find this a well-researched, even-tempered, fair assessment of the liberal media myth. And best of all, the American public comes off looking like a culprit as much as a victim.  Ultimately, people vote with their eyes, ears, and wallets.  If the public demands and devours media slop, then that's what they'll get and, to a large extent, deserve.This is great read.  He's a talented writer who knows his stuff.  And he is very clear about his background, potential conflicts of interest, and personal relationships to those about whom he writes.  No exaggeration to call this a great book"
987,book,"If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it"
988,book,"As a student at Oklahoma State University, I am very interested in journalism and broadcasting.  Eric Alterman's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media.  The purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media.  Alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media.  After reading through the book, I came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than I look at it.  I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media"
989,book,"Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins"
990,book,"After having lived in NYC for 12 years, I finally read this book.   It had been recommended as a must-read for anyone who had ever lived in the city.  Many reviewers commented on the ""leisurely"" pace of the story, and I agree.  The description of the event in the climax of the story, though, I found too long and almost unbearably tedious, especially since such care with detail was missing from a lot of the other events in the book.  The time travel part was especially troubling to me; I wasn't at all convinced of its process.  However, I still enjoyed the book and was very satisfied with the ending.  As many have said, stick with it."
991,book,"This book was on my summer reading list, and I was thinking that itwas going to be horrible, but it was the exact opposite. I love the book and enjoyed every minute that I read it! I love how Finney uses pictures in the book, it helps you to grasp the changes that occured in the scenery of Manhattan."
992,book,"Others have summarized. I'll add that this novel is one of the best I've read. Slow starting, but stick with it. Read the sequel. Also try to find ""The Third Level,"" one of Finney's lesser known short stories (also about time travel/NYC)."
993,book,"The descriptions of 1882 New York smack of reality more than anything I have ever read. The reactions of the protagonist are the best of any time travel novel I have ever read - truly amazingly authentic. The tale starts out slowly, but brings the reader to an awesome action-packed, never-rushed conclusion.  Extremely satisfying. A beautiful, thought-provoking story. There is everything here, science fiction, mystery, action, philosophy, and a bit of romance.  Highly recommended."
994,book,"I bought this book in 1970 when I had just started college. It is one of the few books I have kept for all these years and have re-read regularly.  The premise for the story is a young man, Si Morley, who joins a government program to go back in time to the NY of 1880's. The past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story.  Not only is it entertaining, containing romance and mystery, but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today.This is a book you'll enjoy reading, one I can't recommend highly enough"
995,book,"While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a ""quick, easy read"". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers)."
996,book,"A Quantum Leap of reading.  How his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable, and personal, story around each one is an amazing feat.  I found myself wondering if he did travel back in time - was it possible - could I do it?  I even tried the self-hypnosis he told about - picking the civil war as my target.  No -- didn't work for me - yet!  Would I love to do it!  The ending of this book shook me - he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way.  It's amazing.  Read ""The Mirror"" , read Diana Gabaldon's time travel series -- but please don't miss including this book as your number one, best dog eared copy of your library.  You won't be sorry"
997,book,"This book starts out slow, but once you get past the first few chapters you won't be able to put it down.  If you know anything about New York, you will find it fascinating.  I'm not sure if it would be as appealing to someone who has never been to New York but the story is good regardless."
998,book,"The sense of actually being in the mid-1800's was so strong, that I felt I had to decompress to bring myself back to my own time.  And I did so very reluctantly. A wonderful story with amazing images! Highly recommended"
999,book,I love O'REILLYThere are aspects of his personality that I do not like but Bill is a voice in the wilderness of cable news today.  He yells and screams as much as the next guy but he actually does research to back his ranting points up.  This separates him from everyone else cable news (and radio) weather those people are liberal or conservative.  I honestly don't know what side of the aisle Bill sits on.Overall-I think reading this book is worth your time.
1000,electronics,"First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin"
1001,electronics,"We bought this to backup the iMac G5 that I got my wife for Christmas. I have had an APC since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area.The overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money.I'm not sure if the Powerchute software was updated to run on Mac Tiger, howvever, so I did not install it.Steve Reis"
1002,electronics,"It's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw -- beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power.  This person obviously didn't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the UPS.  The notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software.I agree that I was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem.  Luckily, it was easy to turn this feature off.Five stars for this product, for sure."
1003,electronics,"I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage."
1004,electronics,"I already knew how good this product was before we bought it.  We had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer.  I have recently learned I might have been able to have that replaced if I had thought to follow up.  But I was just so thrilled to have only lost an $80.00 (at that time) product and not a $1,200 computer.  When ordering mine, the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one, I got free shipping, I never even had to leave the house!  I couldn't be happier!!"
1005,electronics,"Electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks, usually at night, but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day. Very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work. This backup battery  takes care of that problem very well. It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works. No linux software but it can still be used without it. The unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery. I have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it"
1006,electronics,It was easy to assemble and matches another one that I bought from the same company a few years ago
1007,electronics,"I have three of these CD towers, and in general I'm very pleased with them.  I like the wave design, and they hold a LOT of CDs.  I don't mind having to take off a whole stack of CDs to get to the one on the bottom, and as long as you balance the distribution of CDs properly, they don't tip that easily.  I always place mine next to a wall, anyway.  My biggest problem is that they are sometimes very difficult to put together.  Of course, that is only a temporary issue, although an incredibly vexing one. "
1008,electronics,"I've had my Wave CD storage rack for almost 5 years now and I'm more than happy with it. It's been moved around, bumped and wedged between pieces of furniture, yet it has held on quiet nicely. I was originally attracted to it's wavey design which for me, is more artwork than just another storage case. I plan to buy another one"
1009,electronics,This product is a great deal.  The problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination.  Get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires (they fit perfectly). Friends will compliment you on your post-modern taste and sense of design as well!  They will use up about 10 CD's worth of space but then you still have storage for about 100 standard cd-cases or 200 thin ones.
1010,electronics,"as someone else mentioned its not the sturdiest rack out there, but it has not tipped over on me so i really cant complain.it looks good, and its easily put together. as for the sturdy issue, i look at it like this. since when do you place cd racks in the middle of the room?? NEVER!! people will typically place them in the corner of a room which is fine and you will NEVER have an issue with the rack at all. i have mine set right near the entrance of the bedroom door and i have brushed up against it and bumped elbows with it, and it ever so slightly moved a little but nothing where i was worried about it falling. oh and i have carpet in my room which makes it for a less sturdy foundation. i have even thought about purchasing another one for dvd's.personally speaking i def recommmend this cd rack"
1011,electronics,"I have never had this device fall over like others have complained of, either.  Granted, I do have mine situated one a hard wood floor but even so - it seems sturdy enough.It is a little irritating with the wave structure how some of CDs won't fit but other than that I find this tower really helpful.  It's a nice and fun way to store your CDs"
1012,electronics,"The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if  I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home. Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before. I will address the concerns of a few reviews here.1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD  audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound.2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc.3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc.4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I  bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black.Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00.5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle.Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one.But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables. "
1013,electronics, I was blown away by the sound quality. Good system at a reasonable price. I would recommend this system to all my friend
1014,electronics,"I had read some other reviews stating that this Home Theater System makes a buzzing noise.  However, I had my doubts so I ordered it anyway and it's great.  No buzzing noise on mine at all.  I have an apartment and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that I couldn't really use anyway because of noise restrictions.  This system is nice and clear and gives me the Home Theater Experience I was looking for.  They give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall.  Granted the speaker wire isn't all that thick, and has a proprietary male/female connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain.  It still sounds great and for under $200 bucks why would you care anyway. "
1015,electronics,"We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco.  It is possible that the newer ""D"" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode.  We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder.  When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room.  It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful.  I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all.  Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again"
1016,electronics,A very good player at a very reasonable price. 
1017,electronics,"This is prob. the best item I`ve boughten this year..!!!Totaly awsome system TV, Radio, Surround all in one..!Great buy."
1018,electronics,"I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for"
1019,electronics,"Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more"
1020,electronics,"packaging by mfg doesn't keep tabs from being broken off, but vendor was great"
1021,electronics,These clear jewel cases make it easy to see what you have and the slim design saves space.  I use them for cd's and dvd's.  I haven't had any problems with them; they are a good value
1022,electronics,"these are very good for dvd or cd storage. very inexpensive and very good quality. people who complain below have fat fingers, thats why they break the cases"
1023,electronics,cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money
1024,electronics,"Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you"
1025,electronics,"It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them.  On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well"
1026,electronics,"This pack offers a cheap pack of 50 slim jewel cases. Buying this package with a spindle of DVDs or CDs is much cheaper than buing CDs or DVDs ready in a case. The look is cool, and these will not break easily"
1027,electronics,I wish they had a rating for zero stars.  I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters.  That's a 24% success rate.  I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters.  Memorex has really gone downhill. 
1028,electronics,"I have used these DVD+Rs for over two years now and they work absolutely great. I have burned movies, games, files, everything. Haven't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the DVD players I tried them out on.Not much else to say"
1029,electronics,"I just finished a 25 package of the Memorex 4.7GB 4x DVD +R Media and have reordered a 50 pack and 25 pack. All my DVD burns were successful. I am using a Sony DVD drive and have been burning my home video creations at 4x with MYDVD software that came with the drive. I have a Kenwood DVD player downstairs and a Sony DVD player upstairs. It plays on both, plus I have made copies for friends with all positive feedback. I highly recommend these discs."
1030,electronics,"  I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex"
1031,electronics,I just burned my first home video DVD on the Memorex DVD+R disc.It worked the first time!  I have a TDK Burner installed in my Dell computer.  The resulting disc works on my wife's Gateway laptop with DVD and also my Pioneer home DVD player.So far so good...no coasters.
1032,electronics,"I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and ""hope"" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters"
1033,electronics,The cost plus shipping still beats the sale priceof a similar item at Walmart. Works fine
1034,electronics,"This is a great product, and you can get it, along with any other products on Amazon up to $500 Free! Participate in a special promotion and get a free $500 Amazon Gift Card at this web site:   nocostnow.info/amazo"
1035,electronics,"I have nothing to compare them to, but I bought 3 of these and they seem to do the job they are intended to do.  I was surprised to see no savings on shipping when I ordered 3 vs ordering 1 at a time, although I am now clear on the policy.  They still were a bargain, as far as I have compared.  I would buy again, from the same vendor"
1036,electronics,I received my Kingston 256MB SD card just as advertised.The unit came in the mail exactly 2 days after Iordered. Worked perfectly and I'm very satisfied
1037,electronics,I was excited when I received the Kingston 256MB digital card on the scheduled date. It sure has a good packaging and works great.An item worth having in your electronics line
1038,electronics,I have had no problems with the Secure Digitial Card from Kingston. It has performed properly for my camera and computer for transferring the pictures. Highly recommende
1039,electronics,I use this card in my Palm TX pda and have it filled with mp3 music and in almost two months have had no problems with it.  Very good memory
1040,electronics,"I received it in a timely manner and am pleased with the performance of the product. It may not be a top name brand, but I can't tell any difference. Thank yo"
1041,electronics,"I bought this card with my Canon Powershot SD200. The card holds a lot of pictures, more than I expected even with a high resolution setting"
1042,electronics,"This once available product has served me well.Very dynamic, universal in use, and user friendly. What more could be asked of a simple battery backup system that doesn't cost hundreds of $.I'm looking for the replacement because it's best duty is under every critical user's computer"
1043,electronics,High speed reader that works flawlessly and at high speed. All you need for your card and computer
1044,electronics,"I got this Item and it worked for about 4 hours, then stopped working, I tried the reader in 2 different computers nothing... I contacted Lexar customer support and they couldn't help me, save your money and buy something else"
1045,electronics,"Compared to other card readers I have experienced, this one is quick and easy. much preferred method of transferring digital images. gets the job done"
1046,electronics,"I used this reader for a week before it stopped working. It worked OK for the week that it worked at all. It would not read xD cards though. It did not detect that a card was inserted at all. I tried inserting the card fully, partially and even tried jiggling it a little. It seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted. It did, however, work with my compact flash card. Then, inexplicably, it stopped functioning entirely. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in Device Manager but the card was dead. I tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all.  Lexar support left a lot to be desired. I explained the problem in detail and the response I got was a generic ""Try restarting the computer, etc, etc."" Then, they wanted me to pay for shipping to RMA their defective merchandise. I sent it back to Amazon instead and got my money back. I'm willing to assume that I just got a lemon, but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a  refund rather than a replacement."
1047,electronics,I love the design and the size of this memory card reader.  Very portable and works great.  Reads pretty much all memory cards that are out there on the market at the moment.  Would recommend it and would buy it again
1048,electronics,"I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their ""tech support"" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, ""try another Xd card"". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk"
1049,electronics,"The Lexar Media 2.0 cannot function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from Olympus. The help site explains how, with my Mac, I can reboot my computer in OS 9 Classic then, download the pictures, then reboot in OS X. Not a satisfactory solution. I felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase. I feel like I simply acquired electronic junk. There was no response from Lexar when I emailed support, which simply added to my feeling of being had"
1050,electronics,"My biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my Win98 (not SE) machine.  Ive only used it with Compact Flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine.  No install problems either, even though the machine/OS is pretty old.The ""pop down"" door is a little goofy, but I just stick a pencil in the door to keep it from closing.  This props it up on the desk so it is a bit easier to get the cards in and out"
1051,electronics,"Compact, portable and works with all the popular media cards: cf I/II, sm/mmc, sd/xd and mms/mmsp. I have one at home and one at the office, both you can take anywhere and doesn't take up alot of space. Easy to use, plug  play. Nice cover opens up and keeps the slots clean from dust when closed. The lid opens and acts as a stand for the reader, a nice angle for putting in the cards.I got mine for less than $10.00, so it's definitely worth it! Lexar has great quality and good design. Highly recommended"
1052,electronics,"The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.  The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set.The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time.It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket"
1053,electronics,"First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphonesalways pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!"
1054,electronics,"I just ordered the second one for our family.  It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould.  They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use.  The software is simple.  The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time.  My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have.  Mom loves that they're affordable"
1055,electronics,"This is the greatest little MP3 player!!! The sound is great (good bass), the size is very convenient and everybody who see it, wants one. It fits in a pocket, has an armband option or a key ring option, even little speakers as an option. I've taken it on so many trips. There is a caution though, even though the software is good for Windows Plus or better, you can not download from the web unless you have Windows XP"
1056,electronics,"Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each ""artist"" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1"
1057,electronics,"This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what ""hold"" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use"
1058,electronics," Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment"
1059,electronics,"I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T.  I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email.  I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through!  The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.  However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around.  A very dishonest company if you ask me.  Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate"
1060,electronics,"In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment"
1061,electronics,"I also bought this item.  Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC.  Rebate denied because UPC was not included.  I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it .  Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained.  To date, have heard nothing from them.  I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC.Ji"
1062,electronics,This is a great CD/DVD holder. especially for the price. It holds an unbelievable 264 DVDs!!! definitely good buy
1063,electronics,"This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it"
1064,electronics,Witht this memory card you will not miss anything.Lot of space and fast storage for your continuos shooting
1065,electronics,"As the other reviewer found out, these cards can't be formatted to work with SD Audio.  Total waste of money"
1066,electronics,"I am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices, however, with my Panasonic SV-SD80 MP3 player, this product was not compatible.  I could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to SD Audio support"
1067,electronics,"With my five megapixel Leica Digilux 2, this Lexar one gigabyte SD card will give me 244 color photographs at the highest-quality jpeg setting! That's equivalent to ten rolls of 35mm film. The write time is (to me) quite fast, so it really performs. So far, I have not encountered any problems with this SD card. And if it stays that way, I'll get another one. "
1068,electronics,"If you snap shots in burst mode, or if you want to take pictures at sporting events, fast cards like those are the way to go.Almost no lag, large capacity, lifetime warranty, no complaints"
1069,electronics," How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  The Lexar Media 1GB SD Card SD1GB -32-231, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card.  Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available.  A 1000MB card should be an investment.  You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity.  Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted.  Then what do you do?  Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs"
1070,electronics,"Works well, especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use. I have my NES and SNES, both of which have huge AC adapters, plugged into this. It saves tons of space on my power strip.The design is a little clumsy though, so it's only getting 4/5"
1071,electronics,"This is a very practical way to use the ""lost"" spot on outlets by the transformers that will use at least 2 spaces with this you can even add 2 in one contruction is good and again is practical"
1072,electronics,"I have had this controller for just about two years and have had no technical issues with it at all. I never installed any software for it, I simply plugged it in and it has worked flawlessly ever since. It may lack the frills of a more expensive controller, but I am very pleased with its toughness. Until there is a game pad for the PC that can accomplish this level of quality while including all the other bells and whistles, I'll stick with the durability feature instead"
1073,electronics,"I installed this controller on winXP.  While I was playing an emulated game I noticed that my keyboard didn't work and there was no way to exit out of the game (alt+enter) to minimize the screen.  So i reset the computer and now the keyboard doesn't work at all, must be something to do with that installation CD.  I recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual, on creating a restore point, that you can go back to, incase something like this happens"
1074,electronics,I nearly bought a Logitech gamepad but saw the glowing reviews of this device. I just got started back into the action and racing genres It's got great touch and seems sturdy enough for the long haul
1075,electronics,I bought this game pad to replace my logitech wingman rumble pad and it works great and its alot better than the wingman rumble pad.I highly recommend this gamepad
1076,electronics,This has got to be the best looking and best performing joysticks out there for the PC. Not only is the performance and feel of this joystick great..but the price is also great.Ta
1077,electronics,"I got two of these, and as others have said, this is a great game pad for the money. It feels sturdy and has good, well placed, buttons."
1078,electronics,"I got this for my baby's room.  I was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews, but it's quite good (though I don't have the ear of an audiophile).  The bass is pretty powerful  the treble is good as well.  There is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well.The room is about 10'x11' and this stereo has more than enough capacity for this room.MP3 cd's appear to work effectively.  Panasonic has generally had good MP3 cd support (subdirectories are supported).I'm very pleased"
1079,electronics,"It's amazing how tough it is to find boomboxes that have CD players capable of playing MP3 CD's - apparently, the industry has decided that most people don't want this feature in their CD boombox (they must assume people get their MP3 fix from iPods and similar devices).  But for those of us who've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest iPod (I think the latest version is down to a quantum-level size device), this is a solid player for that purpose.  And the cassette player/recorder is also handy if you want to tape from your MP3 CD (or any CD, or the radio) for the benefit of those you may know who still haven't gone to CD yet (there are still a few of those out there as well).  Generally, this is a good product, though there are a couple of drawbacks.First, the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries.  This seems kind of silly given that remotes aren't exactly power hogs.  Now, this could simply be a quirk of mine, and may not be a feature of the product overall, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one, so I've decided to live with this (it's not often it'll be on pure battery mode).The other minor complaint is that it's not possible to fast-forward within an MP3 track when playing an MP3 CD (regular CD's can fastforward within a track).  Not sure why it doesn't, since every other MP3 CD player I've come across does (discman, car MP3 CD player, etc.), but it's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view.The sound equalizer is very minimal, but truthfully I wasn't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall, and things in-between.  I found no problem with the modes available, and find that this is doing the job I needed it to do just fine"
1080,electronics,"The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations.  The radio part, hence, was worthless.  The speakers are sub standard, no depth.  Without the remote, little can be done.  All in all, it is not worth trying.  My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality"
1081,electronics,"Just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers, I was searching for CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. ADVANTAGES ARE: 1) The ONLY smaller desktop unit that I found with CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 2) Has sleep timer 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 and 120 minutes. This is handy for CD's, MP3's and the radio. 3) Fairly good sound for the money.4) Easy to use remote. (I leave mine next to the unit).DISADVANTAGES ARE:1) Earphone plug in the back of the unit. When I want to plug in my earphone, it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design!2) My biggest disappointment--no resume on CD or MP3! I listen to alot of audio books and I find this a real inconveince! I have to go to the track that I think I left off or write it down! (My Panasonic MP3 CD small portable has this, why did they forget this in this one?). 3) Terrible reception on AM--STATIC!4) Sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use.I bought this because it is the only AM/FM/CD/MP3/CASSETTE unit with a timer and remote that I could find! Since the AM radio is so terrible, I ended up buying the Sony ICF-M410V so I can listen to my AM talk shows. This one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes, a clock and easy to use.Overall, I still give it a 4 because of it's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes. **And, I wish I would have bought it on Amazon, not at Radio Shack (they were about $25 more). Live and learn! If you are looking for a all in one with CD, MP3, CASSETTE, REMOTE AND AM-FM RADIO, this is about the only one that you will find and I looked for 3 months!UPDATE: September 18, 2006: After owning this one month, I like it better and better! I love the SLEEP feature that you can use up to 120 minutes (2 hours) either on the radio or the CD! This AUTOMATICALLY shuts the unit off. It is a great feature if you are listening to a CD that contains 40 hours of MP3's on it and you don't want it to play all night"
1082,electronics,"I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. "
1083,electronics,I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future model
1084,electronics,"couldn't find a boombox that was lightweight but sounded good and had mp3playback. It is fine, does everything I expected. It gets more useage than my hi priced Bose"
1085,electronics,"The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy."
1086,electronics,Not as easy to use as a larger Panasonic I used to own butotherwise fine. Good sound.  Using CD player and radio.Buying via Amazon as usual is super
1087,electronics,overall i'm very happy. i wish there was a resume feature for cds with mp3s on them. other then that - it's good
1088,electronics,"I was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand, and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic, but when I received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work.  Holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely.  It does come with book page holders, but I don't really use them"
1089,electronics,"So I was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages... could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality... So i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11$. AND it works, I used it for two weeks now and I am pretty satisfied. Just like there is one more review on this item... and it says that it is strong and sturdy.. I AGREE.It is a great item for the money.Vitalijus Stony"
1090,electronics,"It worked much better than expected. The page clips also were very good, but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning/using the item (I put it back on, but fell off a couple more times). I also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well."
1091,electronics,"I have tried a dozen holders; this is the best available.Others tip over easily, or they hold only books of a limited size, or they are large, heavy, bulky, and therefore absurdly expensive, etc...This is light, yet sturdy. Hint: I included a few large metal clips, the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place. With the clips, this bookholder works excellently well.In addition, it is also preforated to fit into any three-ring binder. The manufacturer thought of everything on this one. I keep one in the car for when I read in restaurants, another at home, and still a third on my office desk"
1092,electronics,"Because I'm a free lance writer and reviewer, I often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when I'm direct quoting.I had a book holder from another company, but it was a piece of junk. It wouldn't hold up thicker books and the thin, rounded ""holders"" at the bottom kept popping off. I even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such.It kept breaking and out of frustration, I went to an office supply store to look for another one. The silver Fellowes Book Holder was all they had. Although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy, I was skeptical. I had him go into the office, get me a thick, hardcover book--and proceeded to take the Book Holder out of the box to test it. (Yes, right there in the store!)I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom. The plastic looks flimsy, but I'm tellin' ya, this baby really does well for holding open thick books! I've been using mine for about a week now and love it. No more headaches when I need to get a quote! YAY"
1093,electronics,"I read a lot and I was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page.  I also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page.  Well, I finally decide to try this nice little invention, and let me tell you, it's definitely worth it!  It's cheap, but the plastic works fine and does the job well.  It stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised.  The stand is adjustable.  It's great, it makes my life so much easier, and I'm sure glad I bought it"
1094,electronics,"I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem"
1095,electronics,"Sometimes I need to have a few books open at the same time, and still have clear desk space for note taking. I used to keep one in my lap, or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page, or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so I could open another.  Not any more! Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway??  This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares? You're not going to loose them unless you've got a silver shag rug that's three inches deep, and it's not a big deal to pop them back in. In truth I have two of these pretty good book things"
1096,electronics,This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs.  It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders.  The page holders are easy to put back in.  It saves space on your desk.  I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks.  It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find
1097,electronics,"I wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different PCs.  The first, a Dell M50 Precision laptop with 1 GB memory and a 1.8 GHz processor, would capture sound just fine, but only color haze for video.  I thought that it was because the M50 has underpowered USB 1.1 ports, so I wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop (also 1GB memory).  The best that I got was audio with the sound speeded up (voices sounded like they were on helium) and the same color haze for video.  Apparently, it doesn't pay to scrimp in this area.  I will promptly return the product and look for something better. From the other reviews, it doesn't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent"
1098,electronics,"Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought.  It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work.  Don't buy. "
1099,electronics,"First of all, here are my computer specs:Pentium 4 2.8 GHz/800 FSB1 GB DDR2 RAM2 SATA 7200 RPM hard drives: 80 GB (boot drive), 250 GB (movie drive)Graphics card: ATI Radeon X300 PCIe 128mbSound card: SoundBlaster Live 24-bitVCR: consumer-grade Sony SLV-N750My DVD Xpress model number: USBAV-701 Rev. 2My purpose: To archive old tapes to DVD.Installation of the drivers/software was a quick and painless process. Within minutes, I was already capturing my very first video. This unit works very nicely with retail VHS tapes (I found that it does not respond to Macrovision, though I only tested one tape), home movies, and off-air master tapes (tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts). At first, I captured a short promotional music video at 8 Mb/s in a resolution of 720x480. This produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape. There are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer, but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen.Then I captured a longer home movie, which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a single-layer DVD. My original bitrate of 8 Mb/s was too high, and the higher bitrate wasn't really helping the video quality too much. But if my bitrate is too low, the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a TV. Perform a google search for ""videohelp bitrate calculator"" and click on the Videohelp bitrate calculator link. I use the calculator to figure out what bitrate I should capture in, according to the total time of all the programs I want to put on DVD. Below 7 Mb/s seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback, but it's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies.After capturing this longer movie, I found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot. Now, whenever I operate it, I point a small fan at it, and this seems to keep it cool and running well. But keeping the unit cool shouldn't be the user's responsibility, so it loses points for temperature.While this device works well if the input video has a stable picture, a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss (being copied several times). I tried capturing one of these tapes, which was of a TV show from 1993, and the DVD Xpress did not handle it very well. The result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory. I am disappointed with this.On the other hand, I have a tape that was recorded from TV in 1988. It is the master copy, so there is no generational loss. DVD Xpress was able to capture it just fine.Not once during any of my captures did audio  video get out of sync, so credit where credit's due to ADS Tech for that.After a few days of experimenting with this capture device, I definitely want to keep it. I look forward to finally being able to clean out my VHS closet.My recommendations to other buyers: Understand your source, and you won't be disappointed. There is no way you can make your 10-20 year old tapes look pristine again. But if the video signal is strong and stable, the DVD Xpress should be able to capture it with no problems"
1100,electronics,"I'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users.  Currently I'm running an AMD64 3500+ with 1.5gig ram.  The software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time I was recording my first transfer from a VHS player.  I'm very comfortable using Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 so that's what I decided to use instead of the bundled software.I've created over 25 DVD's successfully and tonight I decided to give the ""Direct to disk"" a try.  I recorded directly from the video source to the DVD and just like that, I had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my DVD player.I have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version 3.7.  I have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes, there were many problems.  But after upgrading to something with more power like the AMD64 with 1.5gig ram...well...it was a whole new ballgame.  Everything worked as advertised.  Just as it should"
1101,electronics,"if you don't want to spend a ton of money and you want the  best quality possible.  i am using the ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my DirecTV DVR onto DVD.  The quality is outstanding.  2 quick complaints, but really these are only minor things:1)  setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure.  the message should have said....""MAKE SURE THE USB CABLE IS PLUGGED IN DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOTHER BOARD""....in other words, in the back of your computer and with a USB port that came with your computer instead of an add on.  easy enough fix, but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple.2)  on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video.  This has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise, but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100% pure video with no errors.  this is a great product....don't look any where else"
1102,electronics,"Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.  The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.  Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value."
1103,electronics,"This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price"
1104,electronics,The DVD Express 2.0 worked the first time I tried it. It always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have. I agree that Ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit. If you are having trouble getting this little baby going I would suggest a computer class would be apropriate.
1105,electronics,"I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future."
1106,electronics,"This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price!"
1107,electronics,This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.It's a great card at a very good price
1108,electronics,"The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. "
1109,electronics,I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology.  I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos.  I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow.  Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy.  Hope this is some hel
1110,electronics,"I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first"
1111,electronics,Product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it. I am using it in an HP M425 5 megapixel digital camera. It will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound
1112,electronics,"I'm a working photographer who has been, after several years use, getting write errors on my Lexar Professional CF cards 1 Gb and 2 Gb. I contacted Lexar about what to do and was told that the professional cards have a lifetime warranty and they are now in the process of replacing my cards, after 40K to 50K exposures on each. Quite happy with them"
1113,electronics,"I purchased these cards on recommendaton of a friend who is a professional photographer that has the same camera that I purchased. The Canon 20D likes these fast cards and it's other capacities which some other point and shoot cameras may not benefit. Check before you buy, as this card works very well with my camera"
1114,electronics,"I used this CF card with my Canon Rebel XT. Write and transfer speeds are fast enough and never keeps me waiting. But this works bcoz of speed acceleration technology. If your camera doesn't support this technology then its of no use. It comes close to USB 2.0 transfer rates.February 15th Update, finally this card failed. After formating the card will work for 15-20 snaps and will hang for ever after that and then the camera will throw a write error. Any amount of formating didn't correct the problem. Finally i have to dump it and now i am using one 1GB Sandisk Extreme III and another 2GB Sandisk Ultra II card. Both are working fine even after some bad handling"
1115,electronics,"Bought this card as a backup for the 1-GB card I normally use, and it's been fast and dependable so far. My 7 megapixel camera produces large files -- lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting, but with this card that hasn't happened yet. Good purchase.Also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar"
1116,electronics,I purchased this media card for my Nikon digital camera.  The 5.1 mega pixal size doesn't matter.  I still manage to get almost 400 digital photographs and hundreds more if I adjust it to 3.2 mega pixels.  I would recommend this media card to anyone with a digital camera
1117,electronics,"After Amazon got off there (...) and decided to deliver this item, which took 2 weeks, everything has been really good.  The 80X speed has helped my camera's performance (Olympus C-8080.  Paid $56 dollars for it and am quite satified with purchase"
1118,electronics,These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality.I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !!Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !
1119,electronics,"If you own a Canon camera, Canon does NOT support WA (Write Acceleration) feature of Lexar's high-speed cards:http://www.lexar.com/digfilm/wa_cf.html Current camera partners supporting Write Acceleration Technology: -Kodak Professional -Nikon -Sanyo -Sigma -Pentax -Olympus Other than that, this is a FAST card, if your camera supports WA, otherwise, it may run at just standard speed and in that case why spend the extra $$$?  Look up your camera on the link before you buy"
1120,electronics,"I just purchased a set of two 4 channel Westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently.  If I tipped one of the units, it worked sometimes, as though it had a bad connection.  I am trying to return them now to the seller.  Good luck if you purchase a set of these.  They seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set"
1121,electronics,"The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling.  I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice.  Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger.  If your having problems, I would start with unplugging other things first.Overall, these have been a Godsend, wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house.  Used to drive me crazy"
1122,electronics,"I have a 4300 square foot home.  I have purchased Novi wireless intercoms in the past and need to add to them.  One has been in the room above the garage, one in the kitchen, and one in the basement near the computers.  Those locations are not on the same circuit. I have never had any trouble getting them to work -- I've just had a couple wear out.  In fact, at our old house, we could pick up communications from our neighbors across the street who had a set and we finally each decided which channel we'd use so we didn't hear each other's conversations!  You might want to remember that when you use them!  Clearly our neighbors intercoms weren't on the same circuit -- they weren't even in the same house!  Maybe the newer ones (mine are at least six years old, but they are Novi wireless intercoms that you plug into the wall) have changed, but I've never had a problem like the one described.  Maybe it's peculiar to the Westinghouse brand"
1123,electronics,"I bought a set of four Westinghouse intercoms.  Usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and don't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people.  These Westinghouse intercoms (and I believe the same goes for the NOVI intercoms) require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit (that is, controlled by the same electrical breaker).  So, if your kitchen, family room, master bedroom, and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system, the Westinghouse system will not work for you.Intercoms are usually for large houses...large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets...hence, this product likely will not work for most people.  I replaced the Westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the WireFree Intercom Reporter...this is a four channel system and it works great...works either with batteries or transformer...it is independent of the electrical circuits"
1124,electronics,"This is not technically a review, although based on what I've read I do plan on buying one of these.  However, I found something on smarthome.com which will inter-connect the two main circuits that most houses have, thus allowing devices like this (and X10) work from any outlet to any other.  This is not yet tested by me, but is at least promising.Device is here:http://www.smarthome.com/4816b2.htmlExplanation is here:http://www.smarthome.com/images/4816dgm_big.jp"
1125,electronics,"I just purchased this unit and once I finally got it working I could not be more pleased. Just be warned that it was not as easy in my two story home to just plug one in upstairs and come downstairs with the other and have it work right away. Maybe I just have some ""funky"" wiring in this house, BUT I had to make about 6 trips up and down those stairs with a friend standing by the unit I wanted in the master bedroom while I tried various plugs upstairs until we finally got the things to work. All the electrical receptacles work fine, so I don't know why it did not work on the first try. Once working they are great...just keep in mind flexibility of placement in the event you have an experience similar to mine. I'm going to order another set to use between the den and my husband's workshop and feel they are a great deal for the cost and so much easier than a ""hard wired"" system"
1126,electronics,I bought this card to go with my Canon 30D and have not been let down.  I can get about 500 JPEGs and 300 RAW.  SanDisk makes highly constant products.  I can set the 30D to take high speed continuos shooting and take 5 RAW pic's and not have the card slow down my camera.  Very happy with it
1127,electronics,This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive. 
1128,electronics,I received this item for use in a new digital SLR 8.3mgpxl camera. It is fast and stores excellent pictures
1129,electronics,"This card is fast and is the right price.  It holds tons of high res JPEGS, and around 200 RAW images (on my Rebel XTi).  Highly recommended"
1130,electronics,"Bought this card along with a Rebel XT as a gift for my girlfriend. It's been performing without a hitch so far, though on burst mode, there is transfer lag: in that, the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card, and so after the burst, the pictures are still being written to memory"
1131,electronics,"I have an EOS Digital Rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade, at first I thought to buy a 1Gb Sandisk memory, but due to the price fall of memory cards I decided to buy the 2Gb card instead. When I inserted the card into the camera, it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in Large/Fine format or 262 in RAW format, that's more than I need even for a one week vacation trip, but if I upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for JPEG+RAW storage.I may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old 128Mb memory card, about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures.I have always trusted in SanDisk products and this card is no exception, quality and performance is as good as I expected"
1132,electronics,"I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone"
1133,electronics,I have been using CF card now for a while in my Nikon d-200.  I have been very pleased with its response time.  In multi shot mode it keeps up with the camera and I never have to wait.  Highly recommended
1134,electronics,"Hard to be verbose about a CF card...but it has performed without a hitch in my Rebel XT. Used a 1GB Ultra II when I bought the camera a year ago, picked up the 2GB card before a family vacation in August. Excellent product, no worries"
1135,electronics,I have had nothing but good experiences with SanDisk products.  This 2GB Ultra II card keeps up with my new Nikon D200 without any problems.  It's speed is also a plus when transferring the files to my PC
1136,electronics,"This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices"
1137,electronics,"I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you ""must"" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice"
1138,electronics,"This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk"
1139,electronics,"I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice"
1140,electronics,"It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. "
1141,electronics,"PROSSmallCuteSelf-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.USB 2.0  1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.Runs cool.CONSNot sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many"
1142,electronics,"It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue)."
1143,electronics,"You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.Overall good value for price"
1144,electronics,"This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says"
1145,electronics,"I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters.  Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands.  Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use.  Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions.  Don't waste your money"
1146,electronics,"Truely wireless, the remote alert sender unit runs on 4 AA batteries. I don't know yet how long they last. Mine are now two weeks old and still good.  The unit senses when ANY movement passes by.  I live in the country and now I know when someone comes in the yard. Before I wouldn't always hear the car.  Only drawback is that it picks up deer, dogs and other critters walking past at all hours of the day and night.  I like this unit.  It serves a purpose for me that other people  may not have, but it works as advertised and nothing gets past it without it alerting me.  The range is said to be 1000 ft.  That is probably correct.  Mine is about 300 ft. fromt he reciever unit and it works great.  The two way ""voice"" speaker is the icing on the cake. I love being able to yell at the neighbors dogs to ""get on out of here"".  It's a real hoot to watch the surprise they get when my voice comes out of the tree.  I have less problems with the neighbor's dogs coming into my yard and bothering 'my' pets now"
1147,electronics,"The Dazzle 6-in-one is perfect.  I have used it to transfer photos/files from my husband's camera (Sony Memory Stick), from my camera (ComapctFlash), from my Ipaq (SD card), and will try it with my new camera (SD card).  It's is way easier than bringing the USB cord and each camera with me.  This is one of the best purchases this non-techie has ever made.  (I have had this for over 2 years with no problem."
1148,electronics,"Bought this from amazon.  Worked well for compact flash cards.  Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera).  so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera.  And all of a sudden, it died on me.  Had to throw it out"
1149,electronics,Simply plug and play. Additionally Dazzle Reader shows up as a separate drive under Window's. Easy to move files back  forth to the reader. Only glich is the stand -- very flimsy.. wish they had a better stand but the product is great and excellent price too ....
1150,electronics,"This is a great product. I would recommend people to buy dazzle card reader. I had this for over 3 months or so. Have not have any problem. I would say, but this one when a deal come by! D"
1151,electronics,This reader (and writer) is absolutely fantastic! I bought this after returning the Biostar 6 in 1 reader from Newe*g. That unit would not read two SmartMedia units I had but the Dazzle knocked it out like a champ. I use it for Compact Flash and SM (4 different brands) and everything works great on the Dazzle. After the rebate the price is hard to beat!
1152,electronics,"This is a great purchase.  I'm very happy with the performance, quality and time to charge."
1153,electronics,"They last and last, but get two pairs so you have some spares.  Need to recharge every week whether or not you use them.  A great product"
1154,electronics,You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous
1155,electronics,"I have been using a Minolta S414 digital camera. The batteries that came with it were only 1600 mAmps. I never got through an entire ballgame without having the batteries run dry. Of course I carried a spare set, but this was less than ideal. I got these 2000 mAmp Monsters and I must say they deliver what they promise. As a result, I've really not needed the backup set, even when shooting games that went into extra innings! The charger is well made, very quick and has easy LEDs to see the charge status from across the room. Overall, this has been a great purchase"
1156,electronics,Just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers. It does just what it's intended to do - produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit. I had no trouble at all with the remote - it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the iPod from a good 10 feet away. My only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful! Altec Lansing could do well to improve their in-box instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself. I was almost ready to return my unit initially when I discovered - only by accessing Altec Lansing's web page for the iM3 - that I had to remove the not-too-obvious plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my iPod 4G 60GB photo. Otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price
1157,electronics,"When I bought it couple weeks ago. I look out side the box is IM3, But inside the box speaker is IM3c. I call the company, they told me IM3 is as IM3c. They said someone on the internet sell the IM3 is all same with the IM3c, And IM3c also support the Ipod video too"
1158,electronics,"I bought mine for travel purposes and use the JBL On Stage more when I am at home. The JBL does sound better but I got a decent price on the Altec, it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option. So I took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night. Thats 4 AA per night. Not exactly cheap. I think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using. I was out of the country but I still wish now that I wouldve taken my ""heavy"" adaptor with me. You live and learn. I guess everyone has special needs, but in this case I can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night.So, these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right. Packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system. Its ok, Id give it more of a 3.5 star if I could."
1159,electronics,"I received this as a Christmas gift and while it's compact, there are a couple of major flaws.  The power button is the only thing on the remote that works.  None of the other controls on the remote work.  Second, it's VERY BASIC.  I would have preferred something that had some ""sleep"" or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control.  The only positive comments I have about this are that it's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf, and it charges the iPOD really quickly when it's docked.  Otherwise, the sound is mediocre and the controls suck."
1160,electronics,"+ Great sound quality+ Powerfull enough to fill my living room (though probably not with 25 people in party mode) with a small footprint. - The remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv. (Probably because the remote is tiny and only has a watch-like battery, so not enough power). Overall, very good quality for a reasonable price. "
1161,electronics,"This system worked great for my 40 GB iPod. The carrying case and interchangable plug-ins are nifty for international travellers. A word of warning -- the 60 GB iPod Photo does not fit in the docking station. Altrec insisted that it does at the time I purchased it in July 2005. Be sure to order the ""Altec IM3 for iPod and iPod Photo"" that is now available if you have the Photo iPod."
1162,electronics,"I bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas. With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more"
1163,electronics,"I don't have much room on my desk, but this copy holder fits perfectly and is still sturdy enough to hold up most texts."
1164,electronics,"I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks.  If you put a textbook on it and turn the page, it collapses and or tears the page.  I wouldn't even use this for a notebook.  "
1165,electronics,This is working out real well as a notebook stand for me.  You can't beat the pric
1166,electronics,"This product is [retty good, but don't even try putting a bood on it, the holder will tip over and it doesn't clip the pages of a book very well. But for papers it's good and it's adjustable, which is convient. It did hold my notebook very well, but for books it sucks."
1167,electronics,"This holder keeps papers upright and in position, but it doesn't handle books particularly well, as the clip cannot grip surfaces as thick as most books and the base isn't as wide as most books when they're opened. I have this AND a book stand so I keep myself covered on both ends"
1168,electronics,"I'm amazed... simply amazed.  The price is way out there... and this obviously isn't for everyone... but it does everything it says... well.Set up is super smooth,  get the manufacturer and model number, type it in during set up on your computer, and it is done.  Thats it.I do have multiple lighting and heating controls and it is a snap to set up as well.  And then you can have the remote send the setup information to other controllers as well.Tip: Don't buy their lighting controls... WAY over priced.  Anything that is Z-Wave will work... Leviton sells a line for 1/3 of the price"
1169,electronics,"I have to say that I was a little bit skeptical because of the large price tag but found out through research that this product was actually fairly priced due to the custom programming features it had.  I quickly found out that this remote was better than other universals out there because it used RF and was able to control multiple AV systems in my house.I have not done it yet, but I plan to buy the Lighting products so I can turn off all of my lights at once from bed each night!!!   Very cool"
1170,electronics,"I've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer. The monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is ONE thing that stands out here above all the other remotes. Wireless control over lighting. I replaced my dimmers and switches with the Monster dimmers and switches and now I can control every light in my house. Monster really doesn't talk much about this feature but being able to hit ""ALL OFF"" at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer. You can even map ligthing scenes to activities. If you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time. Really cool. Good job monster."
1171,electronics,"I tried to install the driver on my computer. The computer went into a loop, just booting, shutting down, and rebooting. I was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point.I'm scared to try it again.Any body want it? I'll sell it cheap. For that matter, just pay the postage and it's yours"
1172,electronics,I have used the device numerous times since the purchase and would highly recommend it. Would buy it again
1173,electronics,WORKS FINE FOR ME BUT FOUND IT ON KODAK WEB PAGE FOR ABOUT HALF THE PRICE. THANK YOU
1174,electronics,I was impressed with the quality of pictures I got with this memory card. I have a very inexpensive camera but the pictures are terrific
1175,electronics,"This is a high quality product, and can be used in several digital cameras with great results"
1176,electronics,"I gave this to my nephew for his birthday--hold lots of pics and videos (at least 250 pics).  I wouldn't say it ever cost as much as the ""marked down"" price, but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores--about $15 cheaper.  I am pleased."
1177,electronics,This card has all of the memory space required for my personal use. I would recommemd it to others
1178,electronics,"Bought this item over a year ago and have had no problems with this card.  It holds lots of pictures (depending on your settings) and hasn't caused me any problems.  Well worth the money!  I take lots of pictures of my son and anytime we go anywhere new, so it gets used a lot"
1179,electronics,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  The Kingston 128MB Secure Digital Memory Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs"
1180,electronics,SD cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems.I don't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at Disney took place. I had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera (which I have since trashed for this incident and bought a new Nikon) but anyway I had over 300+ pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of DisneyWorld. I cried.So as a suggestion...clean off your Memory cards after each event and don't go for the 512MB or the 1GB cards unless you are putting video on it or etc. Now I am a happy person once again since my hubby's going to take me back to DW to replenish those missing pics!=)
1181,electronics,"Bought this card for my XDA I PDA. Worked fine right out of the box. However, this only showed up as 118mb card !!! not sure if this is the SD card itself or the PDA causing the loss of some 10mb worth of space.Also it is slow to write to the card, but quite fast when reading from the card."
1182,electronics,The card works great in my camera. What more is there to say
1183,electronics,"How good an alarm clock is basically comes down to this: When you set the alarm with the three or four settings you need to do--alarm on/off, radio/CD/annoying noise,volume, and in this case the track you want it to play or if you want it on shuffle or not--does it actually do what you specified the settings to do.  The Sony Dream Machine does, and it features two equally accessible alarms as well so that husband and wife (or husband and husband or wife and wife as the case may be) don't need to argue over how to set the alarm for two morning schedules, along with convenient and easy to understand buttons for the radio presets and cd player controls. IMPORTANT NOTE: The two alarm settings are completely independent of each other, so one person can wake up to a CD and the other to a favorite radio station if they like.  My wife is from Japan for instance, and she wants a Japanese pop CD in there, while I'm partial to waking up to NPR news.Best Feature--The Snooze button: It can be pressed multiple times at a shot to set how much time thereafter you want it to make another attempt at waking you, up to an hour later; and it's generously sized so that you can find it easily when you're not quite all there yet.Worst Feature--the lack of any sort of backup battery.  For this price, they should just put in a long term one like computers have--providing just enough power to startup the system and remember settings.  I'm pretty sure a battery like the one Sony features in my video camera (circa 1998, TR3000 bought in Japan) would do the trick while only needing very periodic replacement.Sound--good, not excellent, but it's an alarm clock, not a stereo.  For a kid's room or for your general purpose needs, the sound quality is plenty good.  No one needs 100 watts per channel, crystal clear sound to wake up to in the morning, and this little appliance does an exceptional job of serving both as an alarm clock and a handy, space-saving and attractive stereo.  It's perfect for not only the bedroom, but the kitchen as well.  For the performance to price ratio, you could only do better by blowing the wad for a Bose unit.Not for great-grandma: Younger grandparent-age people will probably be fine with it--say, as a gift--but if they're from the WWII generation or earlier, forget about it; in fact, forget anything with buttons or digital displays. Sony makes really excellent clock radios with the same reliable analogue features your grandparents have come to enjoy growing up but much improved, and they'll appreciate the thoughtfulness of such a gift much better--while this thing would just gather dust somewhere and be an entire waste of money or source of annoyance.If I had to remark on one real downside to this unit, it's that the backlight really is too bright to sleep with it pointing at your face--and be close enough to reach without getting up--while being on a setting that is readable when you're still bleary-eyed.  Add that the control for the brightness is not conveniently located (it's on the back) so you couldn't just reach over in your half-coma state, brighten it, then turn it back down.  They should have added a feature like outdoor electronics have--such as cycling computers and GPS units--where you can press a button, it lights up for a moment, then goes back to it's preset brightness.BOTTOM LINE: The best, most reliable, and enjoyable alarm clock I've ever owned.  It's durable, easy to clean, looks nice, and features two utterly independent alarm settings--so you'll only need one--in addition to generous preset buttons and easy controls.  It's really worth just exactly what Amazon is charging for it"
1184,electronics,"I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.  Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room.  The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing.  It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand.  The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live.  This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash.  I won't miss it at all"
1185,electronics,"Too many disadvantages:1. No battery backup2. Even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance.3. You'd be expecting better sound from this unit. It's acceptable with the radio, but CD sound quality is extremely poor.4. etc."
1186,electronics,"One thing I don't like about this clock radio is that it doesn't have a backup battery.  Currently I usually do not need to rely on the radio waking me up in the morning, but when I do I make sure my Palm PDA is beside the bed to wake me if there was a power outage.I tried the weather channels once, and it didn't pick up very well.  I have an older Sony clock radio (that loses time) that I can use for weather that picks up weather just fine.What makes this a winner for me is the extendable snooze and nap timers.  Now if I want to take a nap I don't have to mess with setting one of the alarms.  I just push one button several times and it's all set.  I would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone.I use the extendable snooze occasionally, but I don't know if there is a point at which it no longer works -- some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze -- this makes it unusable for me because I don't trust myself knowing that when I am half asleep!Sound quality is great, I like how you can set the track of the CD and how loud it should be.  All in all a pretty good clock radio, but if you rely on it and don't have a backup, the lack of battery backup is a serious problem"
1187,electronics,"We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up"
1188,electronics,Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!
1189,electronics,"Just purchased this Sony CD alarm clock and I have to say most reviewers are right on target. While it has superior sound quality and features than the competition, the rear light is very bright and the clock display is almost impossible to read from more than a few feet away. I placed a piece of electrical tape over the rear light unit to dampen the brightness and have decided to keep my 15-year-old Sony Dream Machine alarm clock plugged in next to the new one so I can see the time display off the old one from my bed. Still a satisfactory buy, because the competition produces hard to work,poor sounding crap"
1190,electronics,"I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6"" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.  This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time. "
1191,electronics,"Looks slick, decent sound and great price BUTflimsy attenna and CD player broke after 1 week (on its own - I didn't even open it up after loading in the first group of CDs).  Took it to JVC repair and they couldn't fix it or find out was wrong.  Ruined my impression of JVC.Remember the wisdom ""you get what you pay for"". . . "
1192,electronics,"This is the worst thing I have ever owned!!!! It broke (said there were no cd's inside) after about a week! Do yourself a favor don't get this product, don't buy this brand and don't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too"
1193,electronics,"It was missing the FM antennae. But I was not intending to use the system for the radio. Overall, it is a great system!!Walt - Illinoi"
1194,electronics,"Pros: it's prettyCons: it's garbageSure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage!  So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!)I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died.Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere.  If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy.."
1195,electronics,"The CD trays are a little flimsy, but this audio system really packs a whollop. The sound is excellent. For the price, it has a lot of features, such as Bass/Treble control, a sleep timer, and five CD trays. To get an enjoyable sound, I'm willing to take the risk that a tray may break. I just try to be extra gentle with the trays"
1196,electronics,"Wanted this for the new office, and it fit perfectly on the desk - looks great, and has great sound.  The unit has a quality feels  not ""plastic"".  The remote works well, and I particularly like the fade mute - makes it easy to use. "
1197,electronics,"Strengths: sound, design, controls, 5CD changer, compact designWeaknesses: remote is not well designed (all buttons the same size), doesn't recognize folders on CDsSummary: I was shopping for a shelf system and this one caught my eye so I got it. The sound is excellent in my opinion for such a little system. The displey is also nice, very bright backlight which can be turned off (great when you like to sleep in the room while the system is still on). Overall I am extremely satisfied. The only minus is the remote, it has a lot of buttons and they are effectively the same size (I would prefer big ones for important things like volume, play, forward,..."
1198,electronics,"Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for ""more than 3 weeks."" I hope they will replace my unit with something that works"
1199,electronics,"Great appearance and sound, JVC has produced a nice sounding unit.  Speakers look as great as they sound, no problem handling bass at loud levels.  Tuner is very easy to use, USB input works flawlessly.  Now the bad news, the CD mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any CD, whether store bought or MP3 burned.  First unit died after three weeks, the replacement lasted five.  CD player mechanical design is unable to handle light use.  Will think twice about buying a JVC again.."
1200,electronics,"I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it."
1201,electronics,"The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating. The compact flash card slot still works, though. I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it didn't work with their 4GB SD card. It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card."
1202,electronics,"Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards, type M, doesn't recognize them. Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar, they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed"
1203,electronics,I ordered a Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. I didn't know there was such a thing. When it came everything worked perfect and for a price everyone could afford
1204,electronics,"Buyer beware.  This reader does not work with large SD cards.  I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card.  My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work.  I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet"
1205,electronics,Completely satisfied with the Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. Simple and easy to use
1206,electronics,Easy to hookup and Windows XP displays the drives of the Lexar. Easy to drag and drop files into the drives. Highly recommended
1207,electronics,Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. 
1208,electronics,I used Lexar Media Multi Card REader in my P2120 Fujitsu laptop via a USB 2 PC-Card adapter.  It's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in Windows XP
1209,electronics,"This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices"
1210,electronics,"I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you ""must"" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice"
1211,electronics,"This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk"
1212,electronics,"I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice"
1213,electronics,"It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. "
1214,electronics,"PROSSmallCuteSelf-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.USB 2.0  1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.Runs cool.CONSNot sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many"
1215,electronics,"You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.Overall good value for price"
1216,electronics,"This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says"
1217,electronics,"I like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs, just set back and relax....YOUR COVERED. "
1218,electronics,Sandisk CF is all I use.I have never had a problem. One card went through the wash and still works perfectly
1219,electronics,"In general, I have realised that CF cards have a 1-2 years life. This is my 3rd CF card in 5 years, and my 2nd Sandisk card to-date. My first (also Sandisk) is still working, but its only 32MB so not very useful on long trips except as backup. With a 5 Megapixel Canon, this 512Mb card stores about 200 highest resolution images.  Have used this for only 3 months so far, but have noted that the Ultra II is definitely faster than others. Quality and life seems to be better than the Viking cards I have used, but time will have to tell how true that is"
1220,electronics,my compact flash card works just fine  good here very fast.                     a very happy custome
1221,electronics,"I bought this card about 6 months ago when I received a Nikon Coolpix 5700 as a gift. I have to say, this card has never let me down. It writes images like there's no tomorrow, and it hasn't failed me once. I haven't lost a single image, and I don't plan on it while using this card. SanDisk has done it once again.Buy from Amazon, I paid $20 more @ Staples for it"
1222,electronics,"I'm not beholden to the SanDisk brand, and did quite a bit of research, and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value. In fact, the ""Ultra II"" title does live up to its name, and am very happy with the performance of this product.  Canon 350D takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode, and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace, even at the highest resolution.  Download is speedy, too.I went for two 512MB cards instead of a single 1GB card, for redundancy (keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer), and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason.  Highly recommended"
1223,electronics,"I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too.I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today"
1224,electronics,After reading reviews on every brand sold at Amazon I picked Pioneer since it was about the only brand that didn't have any complaints. I have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent. It uses DVD- disks only but since I never have used DVD+ disks that option is irrevelent to me.
1225,electronics,"When I first got the headphones, I was frustrated...they seemed quiet...not much bass...didn't sound that great.What I've read in other reviews is very true.  Having them seated in your ear properly makes ALL the difference!  I don't normally like things inside my ears, but I pushed it in farther and made them seat right...and now...VERY nice.  Not as loud as my other pairs of headphones...but they don't need to be.  They also cut out like 25-35db of outside noise...which means you don't need as much volume.  I've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though I wasn't listening to music at the time.I hope you enjoy them as I do"
1226,electronics,"Great sound quality, although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt. I recommend keeping the setting on ""Bass"" because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak. Prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear. The case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of effort/time it takes to get them properly in there. Other than those minor issues, its great...I prefer these over any sony/ipod/or creative earbuds."
1227,electronics,"     One thing you will read in reviews when people first use the IM716 headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running.  Had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are NOT reccomended to use while running, bycycling or driving a car.       I use them for long airplane flights, long walks between classes and relaxing at home, and these headphones are fantastic.  Once you get it situated in your ear correctly, it takes a few tries to figure it out, you won't want to take them off.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible; this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format.  If all of your music is encoded in .mp3 at 128kbs you arn't doing yourself justice.  I have some songs in apple losses and some in ACC 192kbs (w/ vbr) and I am very happy with the sound quality.       The clip, located about 6-8 inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla, Bass and High Definition.  The Bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly (for those who complain that the earphones aren't loud enough) and the High Definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat.         Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them.  They are worth MUCH more than the 67.00 I paid for them"
1228,electronics,"I purchased these headphones because I needed isolation from noise and these did the trick. The sound quality is great and the quality of the headphones themselves is first rate. The noise isolation is good for work, planes, anywhere the noise level is too high. Irecommend them for the price"
1229,electronics,"First,these phones are great but I want them in black.Now if you don't get a good ear seal they will sound horrible.The treble is silky,the mids are natural and the bass is tight,well defined and deep.I should know bass,I'm a bass player of 40 years and it's like being at a live show.Amazon sells these for $73 with nextday shipping.Get yours NOW.They take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price,it's the best deal out there.The sound quality is amazing.My sony 71s are history.Enjoy from Bassin J."
1230,electronics,"After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them.1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal.2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak.3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower.4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod"
1231,electronics,"This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in ""hi-fi"" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion.The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening."
1232,electronics,"I had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since I work in a loud environment. I had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews weren't favorable. I was nervous. However, I bought these because of the name Altec Lansing has in audio. I was shocked when I first listened to them. I had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable. But wow! The clarity of these phones are incredible. No matter what others said about these, I found the bass to be tight, but not booming. If someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs, then they need to stay away from headphones period. If you are searching for a pair of IEMs, then if I were you, I would seriously consider this pair. Just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way, which I never really found that to be an issue. I don't really understand what others were doing wrong with that. If you bought these, I highly recommend it, you would not be sorry. I am thouroughly impressed with mine"
1233,electronics,Grossly over-priced and useless - Sony's $10 headphones sounded just as good.  The headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best
1234,electronics,This product works well. You can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders. Theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside. I can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient
1235,electronics,"I was so excited to get this for my iPod.  I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy.  There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit.  If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box. "
1236,electronics,great produce.much more conveinient when you have multilpe riders in the car so that they can share
1237,electronics,"After I bought my iPod a charger, a tape adapter, an FM broadcaster, a case, a  running wheel, and a water bottle, I decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car.  These little Belkin numbers are quite nifty.  They hold the iPod in a nice position in my cupholder such that I can glance down at it instead of picking it up when I need to review the playlists/switch songs.  Overall a nifty product - now even better that it's a little cheaper."
1238,electronics,"With a price here on Amazon far better than some of the brick-and-mortar stores, this was an easy purchase to make. My car has unusually large cupholders yet, by simply flipping the base of the TuneDok over, I still managed to get a tight fit with no wobbling for my 3G iPod"
1239,electronics,"If your iPod has a protective cover (e.g. skin, casing, etc.), then the iPod will not fit in the holder of this kit.  Otherwise, you can fit a bare (uncovered) iPod on it well.* The kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes, including adjustable cupholders.  * The holder swivels, so you can have your iPod facing straight up or at various angles.  * The opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the iPod.  * The holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the iPod.  It actually holds the iPod well."
1240,electronics,"Other reviews mention three cup sizes. More specifically, there are *two* cupholder inserts (small and large), a special bottom attachment (for either of those) to be used in adjustably-sized cupholders, plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability. That makes (at least) six possible combinations, enough to fit any need.And, yes, the holder tilts (and the cupholder insert swivels) to give you the best reading angle. But it doesnt tilt too loosely - you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs; it's even a bit bounce-tolerant, allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt.Lastly, the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down, with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom (now top) of the insert, making a very nice desk stand for when I'm not in the car"
1241,electronics,This item is very useful for my car because it doesn't have any unocuppied space near to the cigarette lighter socket.I find it very useful
1242,electronics,This is perfect for my iPod and keeps it totally secure while driving.  Great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly. 
1243,electronics,"I purchased this to use in my LG VX8100 mobile phone.  I have used it for MP3's and has been working fine.  I initially had some problems with playing the MP3's but found that Verizon had the MP3 setting turned off on the phone.  Once I corrected this, the Mini SD has been working fine.  Only once I had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the LG not the Mini SD card.  No problems since"
1244,electronics,Must say that the item was better than I expected. Thanks to the seller and will buy again!!!
1245,electronics,"I purchased the Mini SD 512 MB flash memory card for my LG 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone.  It was easy to install and I could use it right away.  Also it came with an adapter for the larger SD, so I can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if I so desired"
1246,electronics,It work very good and I have found nothing wrong with it
1247,electronics,"This expansion is great, now I have over 120 songs loaded in my phone. Great Media player"
1248,electronics,"If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more.This device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight. No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time. Looks aside, what does it do?It diffuses your flash's light so you get a softer and more spread-out look to your flash. No more pictures looking like you're shining a spotlight on people. This has a more ""natural soft light"" look to it. I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room.The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output. You may have to dial up your exposure (meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage). The tradeoff is irritating sometimes, but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos."
1249,electronics,This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.PROS:Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.A quality product that works.CONS:Reduces the amount of light cast upon subject (should be expected with these types of products)
1250,electronics,"I am probably one of the most musically/sound impared people on the planet.  I rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards.  I only notice substantial jumps in sound technology.  I am very reserved about getting soundcards, as I dont think I ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound.  I have gone from a adlib, to a SB, to SB16, to Audigy LS and now to this card.  That being said, this is probably the last card I will even pick up or need.  The sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards, and is amazing clear.  I love the front panel for adding my headphones if I need them.  I couldnt be happier with the price I paid or the product itself.Amazing buy.  I cant say enough good things.  I dont speak geek about the improvements, its like art.. you know what you like, and I love this card"
1251,electronics,"Everything I have tried to do with the sound card has been easy to do.  Great sound, great hardware and good software. "
1252,electronics,"       I have had the X-Fi Platinum for about one month.  I upgraded from Soundblaster 5.1, a big upgrade.  I have an Asus Motherboard, AMD processor and NVidia video and have not had any problems at all.  I got the card to record vinyl to CD.  I have about 500 albums.  The advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point.         I have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine.  The recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects.  I have put recordings from the records on my mp3 and burned cd's.  Better sound than a casette tape and I've just scratched the surface with the software features.         I have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it.  All I need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features.   The card is expensive but worth it, particularly if you have a specific use for it.  Take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available, you deserve it."
1253,electronics,"First off, not a perfect product far from infact, takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions arn't really clear. I had the Audigy 2 ZS before this sound card and it was a simple install card, install drivers and your good to go; huge improvement over the onboard AC97. This was the first problem, the fact that I had drivers on my system from a previous Sound Blaster card, had to sweep them from my system. my next problem was that the X-Fi drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards, but nothing that updates from there website won't fix (the original drivers must be installed first). Now why would I give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5, the sound is incredible. If the Audigy was step up from the onboard, then the X-Fi is a giant leap. Great for games and movies"
1254,electronics,"Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issuesCons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless.This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for ""X-Fi popping/crackling"".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial ""hacked"" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the ""the fastest sound processor"" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars.UPDATE 06/12/2006I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)"
1255,electronics,"Hardware was A breeze to install.took about 20 minuets including the bay.Same for the software, no problems.Sound Quality is much improved over my old live card.In battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 2.4/radeon 9700 pro/512.Before I would freeze framing during start in rooms, and during game play in intense situations.Now with the X-Fi I have none of that, and the game runs much smoother overall. Dvd movies sound much improved. Music is also much improved. The only problem Ive  had burning expanded mp3's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far. Software interface is also A bit lack luster, but is functional. Card is worth the price, hopefully upgrades will improve interface. "
1256,electronics,"The last soundblaster I had used was a soundblaster Live a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been relying on onboard sound on Nforce based motherboards. Sound quality was okay, but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs. I decided to upgrade to the X-fi when I started to have sound dropouts while playing Oblivion. Sound quality from the X-Fi is great, especially with headphones. I'm only using the Drive bay I/O panel for the headphone jack, but the price of the Platinum version wasn't much more than just the basic card, so it was money well spent. If I had this set up as a media center PC, the remote control functions would make this an even better deal.A few notes:-I had no problems installing this on an NForce4 based motherboard (Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe)-The I/O drive bay only comes in black. If you still have a tan case you're out of luck-There is a digital SPDIF output available on the back of the card. It's a mini 1/8"" jack, and unfortunately no adapter to RCA jack is included"
1257,electronics,"I've been a Turtle Beach lover because I'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but can't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio. The quality Turtle Beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value. Been using Santa Cruz for years and it runs great. After upgrading CPU/Motherboard and to Z-5500, found the Santa Cruz seems to be lagging, usually about 3-5 glitches (sudden stop of sound) during mp3 playback. It might be my system's problem but anyway upgrade to Montego DDL fixed the problem. Used optical output on Montego DDL and it sounds good enough to me. But Montego DDL has a microphone problem (too low volume) that I can't live with.So I tried X-Fi, only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality. When I put it with Z-5500, I can't believe the quality it delivers. I'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell. Some people complain about no optical output on XtremeMusic and no DDL on the whole X-Fi line. But you really don't need to. Man, the quality from 3 stereo cables at X-Fi is way better than optical output from Montego. This is when I reallized that for audio products, you need listening to compare, instead of looking (the spec) to compare. XtremeMusic should be good for most people but I still bought Platinum version for future proof anyway. In my value, not quality, oriented mind, I still vote for Creative this time. Creative beats Turtle Beach this time. Beats it really hard.Of course, the microphone is fixed too"
1258,electronics,All I can say is that they are good sleeves and they are nice to have to protect CD's/DVD's
1259,electronics,"I thought this would be a great buy, but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy.  Screw that"
1260,electronics,"Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. I agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another.They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room. Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases."
1261,electronics,I purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at Circuit City without first looking at the price. I was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax. I purchased the same sleeves at Walmart later the same day for 2.99. Ciruit City has great prices on many things (particularly electronics) but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced. (Same is true of many items at Office Max). I am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves (when purchased from Walmart or a simlar discounter at least) and they get the job done. These sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the open-ended sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in. These sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected
1262,electronics,"These are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds. Can't say anything else about them - except this - I noticed when I opened the box they came in 'my' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band. It did not really affect them adversely, but just be aware that yours may come this way also"
1263,electronics,"The 50 pack are all white, and the window in the front is a useful feature - lets you see what's on there without resorting to opening the envelope. The tab on the back helps keep the disc from falling out - a nice touch"
1264,electronics,What's to say?  They're paper sleeves for CD's ..
1265,electronics,I paid for it and got an e-mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation. Called the 1800#. It's been a month. If it's this hard to get the plan I wonder how it will be if I need to replace my product
1266,electronics,Always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year
1267,electronics,"This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer  uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers"
1268,electronics,"Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out  how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 player"
1269,electronics,"Great battery life, easy to use, all around good.  The only minus is the dependency on ITunes"
1270,electronics,I bought this as a gift and the person loved it.  Great deal for the money
1271,electronics,"It's conviently small, but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc, but it has HORRIBLE battery life. I'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and I have to recharge just about every other day. Other than that it's great, just be prepared to have to recharge it ALL the time"
1272,electronics,"Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use.  Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition.  Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good.  "
1273,electronics,"Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it"
1274,electronics,This iPod was great while I could use it.  Then my wife took it and now I only see it when she needs me to recharge it!!  I guess it is safe to say that she likes it too!!
1275,electronics,"Very happy with the Nano.   It was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly.   She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening!Good buy, good product, good amazon!"
1276,electronics,"This is a TV card I used to replace my aged Lifeview FlyVideo98FM card, so I could watch/record (Trinidad  Tobago) games from TV during the world cup in June '06.The TV quality is the best I ever seen from a TV card to date. Give that it is an ATI based card, this is really good stuff.Unfortunately, the software package has let me down. The card came Bundled with Cyberlink PowerCinema. In day to day usage of my computer, I like to have the FM Radio function on. With the old card and 3rd party FM Radio software, there was no issues at all... With this new card, I often can't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering - this on a computer with 1GB RAM and 2 hard drives! I definitely blame the software for this. If the sticking becomes too much then the Radio stops altogether. I'm forced to close and re-open Power Cinema to listen to Radio again.TV is at least stable while doing other stuff, but you can't shrink Powercinema down to a 320x240 window. also there is a 2 second lag between TV and computer watching the same TV station. This never occured with the old card. Intervideo's WinDVR used with this card had no such issue.It's a pity I don't have XP Media Center Edition (XP Pro I have) to compare XP's Media Center software with Cyberlink's.. Somehow I think Media Center will perform better. WinDVR works better too, barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card.PowerCinema works, but it's not very intuitive. The software is written for the novice user with NO advanced options at all. When recording, you do not know exactly what quality you're using outside of ""good"", ""better"" or ""best"". You can't even change the default recording folder!I am sure that this occurs with other brands of Theatre 550 Pro cards, not just MSI's version. As a side note, the remote that comes with the card works well.In conclusion, It's a card worth getting if you can deal with PowerCinema's Issues, or find a better program to use with the card."
1277,electronics,Just finished burning through my first box of these and they are terrific. Not one was a dud. I always trust all Khypermedia Blank disks cause I have never had a problem with them. Don't hesitate to buy yourself a box of these to use for your own project because they will last you forever. Great bargain for a great produc
1278,electronics,"I own many Lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance. However, I must add that LEXAR (USA) provides EXCELLENT service.   I live in Cape Town, South Africa..... whilst I was formatting one of my LEXAR cards in my Nikon D70, I terminated the formatting halfway (accidentally).... card was damaged.....  sent card to LEXAR USA after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days I had a brand new card couried to me by LEXAR..... no questions asked.... This is outstanding service!!!  Well done Lexar.....Exceeded expectations"
1279,electronics,Fast read/write times are a must for me.  I am pleased so far with the card
1280,electronics,"awesome product. fast data collection, and holds about 450 photos. i would purchase again"
1281,electronics,"Lexar Compact Flash Cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals. The ""WA"" (write-acceleration) feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition. Excellent return on investment! A MUST buy. ~""O"
1282,electronics,"When I bought my camera, the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package.  It was very quick--far faster than any of the 512MB cards I had on hand, even those that were of the previous generation of ""professional"" Lexar cards.  My camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card, to the point that I can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly.My only complaint is in the card's reliability.  After about a month of medium-load use (about 1000 photos taken), the card ceased functioning while within the camera.  Neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers (including the PC Card slot on my laptop with a CF adapter).  The image ""rescue"" software provided by Lexar on the card was of no use, either.Lexar replaced the card, which has worked fine ever since.  However, I purchased a second one, which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken.  Again, the included ImageRescue software failed to help--it found errors but could not do anything about them--but a commercial image recovery tool I purchased was able to read, then reformat, the card, and it has worked reliably since"
1283,electronics,"I purchased the Lexar 1GB 80x Pro CF card for use with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT 8 mega pixel DSLR camera. I also have a SanDisk 1GB CF card which I also use with the DSLR. Of the two cards the Lexar is far and away the fastest in recording  reading, I can take multiple shots at the camera's highest resolution (8 Mega Pixels)yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more. There are also no compatibility problems.To be fair to the Sandisk, it's an older model I purchased a few years ago for a MP3 player, however I now use it only as a backup to the Lexar.I plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future"
1284,electronics,I just purchased the Canon 20D and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities.  Plenty of picture room and I plan to purchase a 2GB prior to my trip to IRELAND.  Price wise I did great and the turnaround time was excellent.This card was ranked No 1# in two seperate on line test so I was very sold prior to my purchase. 
1285,electronics,"If you find that they UPS is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up, there's something wrong with your configuration. The UPS is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer BIOS to restart the computer. This happens only after the UPS has sent a shutdown signal to the computer. You should not power on the computer until the UPS is done with its power up procedure. If you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after AC power is back, you should set your computer BIOS to Power On when AC power is restored. Since, while the computer is off, it doesn't know when the power comes back on, when the UPS cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on"
1286,electronics,"I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service.The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer.  Also included is ""PowerChute Personal Edition"" software.  This software replaces the UPS option used under the ""Power"" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel.  PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs.  PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar.  It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference.In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets.  Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the ""surge only"" outlet row.When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load.  It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly .  The default method it uses is to place the PC into ""hibernation mode"", saving the desktop exactly ""as is"" for future start-up.  It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly.If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased.  However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks."
1287,electronics,"I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so.Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here"
1288,electronics,I would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime.  Under a 200W load it only lasted 3 minutes while the Back-UPS ES 500 lasted almost 12 minutes.  The ES 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime.  In my opinion this UPS is only good for very small loads (less than the average computer)
1289,electronics,"The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit.This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time. I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers.You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead. You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit)"
1290,electronics,"I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products.My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC.NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless"
1291,electronics,"I bought 5 of these for the computers in the house. I would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all I need is about 30 seconds of power. I noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on... To my understanding this unit detects (dirty power) and when it detects it, it will then stop accepting ac power. I think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up"
1292,electronics,Designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes Delorme No support!!!!!!!!!
1293,electronics,"I have had this for about 2 years and I travel about 100 days a year by car.  I have it hooked up to my laptop, which is on the passanger seat.  It has never left me down.  In fact I would be lost without it, literly.  I tracks where I go anywhere in the US with the existing software.  Nothing else to buy !!!  It pinpoints where I am at anytime.  It's GREAT.  If you travel a lot like me via car, and have a laptop, a VERY GOOD, AND LOGICAL PURCHASE"
1294,electronics,"Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages"
1295,electronics,"I have an earlier version of this program and the antenna. It works well in the car with my laptop. I did not have the trouble others had with service. I ordered their latest version of their 3_D Topo map program. It was scheduled to be shipped in late March, 2001. I had an immediate need for the program and called them. I talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to. I asked for a Beta version to use until the new version was released. In less than a week I received the full version (not the Beta version). You can't get better service. Every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily"
1296,electronics,Ultra II gives very good speed to make sure your camera isn't waiting on memory. 
1297,electronics,"I've had this product for over a year and use it with my Nikon D50. It has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments, example: blowing beach sand, salt water mists, and in high heat and humidity.I bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her Canon SD600. Would buy this brand again"
1298,electronics,I used it in Brasil and had it developed.  I was very happy with it.  It was the very first time I've used a digital camera
1299,electronics,"The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this"
1300,electronics,"This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii.  Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD"
1301,electronics,"It's the fastest and most realiable SD card I ever used. I heard SanDisk has released a newer one that's even faster, but this one is all I need. I bought two 512MB cards to be used with a digital camera (Nikon D50) and never lost anything"
1302,electronics,I can only say positive things about this memory card.  It does a fabulous job for my 7.1 mega-pixel digital camera.  Anyone who is in the market for a fast memory card with lots of storage this is the one I recommend.  
1303,electronics,"I have several Sandisk products USB Compact Flash and SD, have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days (10MB  15MB cards)  Have allways found them to work great and a good value (dollar cost) for the quality.  The new ultra II SD card is my second SD, also have a 256MB card (also Sandisk not ultra however)  These cards work well and keep on going like the Duracell Bunny!  There are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality"
1304,electronics,"There's a review here where someone takes their COMPUTER and analyzes the performance of the card.  Unfortunately, most of the time what matters is how the card works with your CAMERA.  A camera generally doesn't move data as fast as a computer, and it has to process it first - so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images (or other files) to your hard drive.  If that matters to you, great.For the rest of you, especially camera users, here's the real story:- You need a faster than standard card if you plan to use 30fps 640x480 video.  It's also a good idea with high resolution cameras, if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images.- But ... I just bought a different 512MB SD card for $10 after rebate.  It's hard to beat that price / performance ratio if you're just storing photographs.  Sure, video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year, but other than that, regular speed cards work fine for many uses.Always buy what's right for your needs.  And, if the price differences are small, go with the faster card.  There are promotions every week on various memory cards, look for one if you have time.  Those can make higher speed cards a good value, though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well"
1305,electronics,"I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on.  Op/Tech came up with the solution!  All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go.  Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway.  Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots.  It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used"
1306,electronics,"This is an excellent cd burner. I have purchased so many and all of them are great. I have no complaints and I feel that this product is of the best quality, long lasting and very durable. When I build computers for my customers I always purchase this burner."
1307,electronics,"This is my first DVD Burner and the first time I used one of Amazons merchants.  I had some concerns about ordering, but everything went very smoothly.  Its a good way of purchasing a bargain and I'm very happy with the Sony DVD Burner"
1308,electronics," I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true.  My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster.  One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me. I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none."
1309,electronics,This DVD burner has exceeded my expectations. Additionally the price was right including a rebate offer with my effective price lower than some no-name brands
1310,electronics,Amazon service was fast. Drive installed easily and is working well after 3 weeks
1311,electronics,The drive works great.  It was a bit difficult to install in my Sony computer as the two faceplates that came with the unit were different than the ones on my computer case--seems like Sony could pay attention to a bit more standardization on such simple things.  Service from Amazon was great as expected
1312,electronics,"I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it."

1314,electronics,"This card is lightning fast. I am using it with my Canon SD700 and works great. Only drawback is that it is slightly expensive, but quality never comes cheap. :"
1315,electronics,"I recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through Amazon.  It did NOT have the notch at the bottom (as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake), so I phoned SanDisk and was informed, based on the serial number, that the card IS authentic.  So apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern"
1316,electronics,This memory card is great - great quality and allows my 6 mp camera to take TONS of pictures.  I highly recommend this product
1317,electronics,I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption. I've been tempted to buy another one. 
1318,electronics,It's a memory card and it works!  I have never had a problem with any memory card I have owned including this one.  I was told SanDisk was a good brand and so far (5th memory card of theirs I have owned) they have all been reliable
1319,electronics,"This card allows me to store 330 pictures at the highest resolution and the lowest compression.  If you want less resolution and/or more compression, you can store over 1,000 pictures on this one card.  The other big advantage is the very fast transfer times to and from my PC"
1320,electronics,"This flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months.  I used Viking's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response.  They offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed, they gave me an RMA to ship it back for a replacement.  I had a new one within a week, no hassle, no fees (other than the $1.50 to mail it back to them).     I never expected such great customer service.  The new drive is working fine, so hopefully that was just a bad batch"
1321,electronics,"This USB Flash Memory Drive works exactly as described, and I'm glad I bought it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use.  My laptop has two USB ports, one directly under the other.  This device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second USB device to the other port at the same time.  I've given up on the rebate.  It's been nearly 5 months, and follow-ups have not helped"
1322,electronics,the USB flash frive is super easy to use and and it so small to cary anywhere. I use it for presentations and to load other computers that I'm working with. I would recommend it for not only the great price but the size and value.
1323,electronics, It works sweet it saves my from dragging around my laptop
1324,electronics,"nice simple design, easy to use, worked great for me so far"
1325,electronics,"When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before.  The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home.  After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods.  In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair!  What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable.  I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular Memorex product"
1326,electronics,"I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5."
1327,electronics,"I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are.  However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks.  [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.]  I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it.  If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away.My main complaint is that I can't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid.  I hate to have to pay $7-$8 for stuff I don't need.[My collection is now at over 1800 different DVDs, so I have some experience with cleaning them."
1328,electronics,"I had a DVD that was scratched during shipping. One repair kit did nothing to help it. I considered using the Skip Dr., but I never cared for what it did to the disks. My church's Media Center uses the Optifix system, so I decided to try it, too. The scratch was gone, and the DVD plays with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way; some scratches cannot be repaired at all. I just know that it worked great for me"
1329,electronics,"I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability.  It's going back in the morning.This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches.  I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.  For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine"
1330,electronics,"Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the ""repair"" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?"
1331,electronics,"I'd had quite a few previously viwed DVDs that had scratches.  As a result, my DVD player would freeze.  This product fixed a couple of DVDs for me.  As far as the haze, you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of Optrix afterwards.  I stopped buying DVDs new unless I can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin"
1332,electronics,"Nice package for the beginning guitarist. Everything you need to start playing right out of the box. Guitar is well made and has a nice sound. Only problem was I had to change the strings, as they were tarnished and would not hold their tune. Good value for the mone"
1333,electronics,It is a compact flash reader/writer and it does exactly that. So I am happy with it
1334,electronics,"I use this little device with my Apple Powerbook to transfer photos taken with Canon digital cameras.Mac OS X recognizes the unit with no additional drivers required, and it works great.  Much more convenient than attaching the camera itself to the computer every time"
1335,electronics,I bought this becuase downloading pictures from my Digital Rebel XT Camera took forever and a day to complete. Using this drive only took about a minute to download 2 Gigs of pictures!You don't need the CD if you have windows XP. 
1336,electronics,"i have a card reader slot in my computer, but i purchased this to keep in my camera bag just in case i want to download to a computer that doesn't.  it works great, but my only complaint is that it's a little bulky.  other than that it's a great card reader"
1337,electronics,"This SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMate USB 2.0 Reader/Writer is a neat little device.  I just pull the Compact Flash card out of my camera, stick it in the ImageMate, plug the USB cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a camera/computer transfer or worry about draining the camera's battery.  I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing.  I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it.  The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable"
1338,electronics,"I spent $10 on a MediaGrear keychain CF card reader first. That reader is usable, but it is hard to pull my CF card out. I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card. When I plug the reader into my computer, it works immediately, no need to install any driver if you don't need to use that transfer button."
1339,electronics,"From appearances and description, this appears to be identical to my SDDR-92 (no A15) except for the shape of the button.This SanDisk is an excellent unit - compact and reasonably slim, with a detachable USB cord.  It is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case (unlike my Dazzle which is fine for a desk top, but awkwardly shaped for compact storage).The unit is reliable and fast, and, unlike the 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters, this unit only uses one hard-drive letter.  It supports reading, writing, deleting, etc., and works with either USB 2.0 or USB 1.1.If you do not care about the button software, this unit installs plug-n-play, without needing a driver CD (at least on Win 2000 and XP).  It simply appears as a removable hard-drive letter in Explorer.I did not install the button software because I am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer.  I would rather be in full, manual control of how and when things happen, and where files are put.I think that this is a 5-star unit, but I downgrade my own unit to 4 1/2 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions.  In both the instructions, and on a sticky label on the unit (which I still have not been able to fully remove), it proclaims that you MUST install the button software before connecting the unit.  I ignored that warning, and the unit worked fine without any installation needed.One of the important requirements in a card reader is portability.  Since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer, the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the USB port.  The SanDisk SDDR-92 meets this requirement, although it proclaims not to.This is a good choice for a CompactFlash Reader/Writer."
1340,electronics,"This controller is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is it wireless, but it corrects my only gripe about the Microsoft S-Controller:I'm 6'3"", and have fairly large hands. I love the layout of the S-Controller, but the ""arms"" are too short for my hands. This leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions, and ends runs in Forza and Call of Duty long before I'm ready to quit.The Logitech controller's arms can't honestly be more than a half-inch longer than the S-Controller's, but it makes a world of difference. I highly recommend this controller not only for it's fantastic wireless performance, but for actually being *more* comfortable than the S-Controller.Another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a memcard/headset slot, and it's a valid complaint. I found the perfect solution in the Logitech Wireless Headset, which can be had here for $20. It works great, and it should be noted that Microsoft still wants $30 for the standard wired headset, which comes with an incredibly-weak clip for the boom mic.All in all, this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the Xbox. Pair it up with the wireless headset from Logitech, and you have a completely wireless control/chat setup for $50 a pop. You honestly can't do better, for any amount of money"
1341,electronics,I thought when I up graded to the plasma things couldn't get any better I was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top I love this thin
1342,electronics,I bought this Controller at Walmat for around 32.00 worth the money no lag whatsoever buy this ControllerLe
1343,electronics,The controller is exactly like the Microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the T.V. and not having a cord in the way.  The controller works perfect
1344,electronics,"Wireless is the way to go!When I put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place... Singular and clean looking this Sweet little controller is, IMO, another triumph by Logitech!Though a little smaller than the S-type, it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance. I got mine used and, once again, put old batteries in it(takes 2)...even four months later, I am just now getting the low battery light flashing...Still VibratesStill Responds AcuratelyAnd the analog sensitivity is better than the wired.Get it, get it... GET IT!!"
1345,electronics,"I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally."
1346,electronics,"I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up."
1347,electronics,"I love this controller.  I have small hands for an adult, and the pad fits me well.  I like the shape better than even the now-standard Controller S shape.  I have no problems with delay or drift.  I haven't used the D-pad, but the thumbsticks and buttons work great, though I'm not a terribly heavy user.  This pad works better than either the Pelican Eclipse or Soul that I own.  My Madcatz Lynx is better, but way too big for my hands.  I like the feel of the plastic.  The only thing I would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top, though I've never had a problem with grip"
1348,electronics,"I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first."
1349,electronics,"I use a laptop since I am always on the go. I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time. I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop. It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great, but it really doesn't do much, if anything at all. I think the idea of the cooling pad is great, but not effective"
1350,electronics,"GREAT ITEM, POWERED OFF LAPTOP ITS FANS WORK QUIETLY TO KEEP LAPTOP COOL. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY US YOUR LAP, WITHOUT FEAR OF OVERHEATING YOUR COMPUTER. AN INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION TO PREVENTING COSTLY REPAIRS. WISH I'D PURCHASED EARLIER AS I ALREADY FRIED MY CD/DVD DRIVE AND HAD TO REPLACE THEM. GOOD PRODUCT TARGUS"
1351,electronics,"Arrived on time and in excellant condition. It works very well, my laptop is much more comfortable to use"
1352,electronics,"You're money is better spent on another product.It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made.  A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged.  I had one fan made a scraping noise.  The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in. "
1353,electronics,I like it. It moves the air out the back pretty fast. Keeps my legs from melting with my HP shooting all the air down. Now I can actually work in longer stretches because I don't have to take time to air out my lap
1354,electronics,really like the chill pad. Keeps my laptop cool!! does its job and i would recomend it to anyone.Lizz
1355,electronics,"I have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap, bought the Chill Pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down. It would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable"
1356,electronics,This product is cheaply made and noisy. The USB power cable developed a problem after 30 days. Don't get ripped off. Avoid this unreliable product
1357,electronics,"I love this Tablet, It's just like working with the real thing with out all that mess, just got to get used to it, I never thought I woulde use the modern art tech but I gave it a chance and I love it."
1358,electronics,"I love this tablet!  I get the functionality of a tablet computer on my little thin Sony.  I almost bought a tablet notebook, but it was so heavy.  I have the best of both worlds now! "
1359,electronics,"What an amazing product for such a small price.  It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers.  The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics.  I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures.  It really makes a difference.The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice.  I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost.The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools.The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed.  Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher"
1360,electronics,"Before purchasing this Wacom, I did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation. I have no complaints. I can't complain about the size because I knew what 4"" X 5"" amounted to before I bought it. The clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to, but what doesn't? Like the title says, it's just what I was hoping for"
1361,electronics,"This is a wonderful item.  I upgraded my tablet and it is amazing!  I had fast shipment, product was in great shape, and I love it.Thanks!"
1362,electronics,"If you do a lot of photo retouching, the Graphire4 will give you a lot more control than a mouse.  The pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking. The lighter you press, the less dense the mask is.  It allows you to ""paint"" in the correction/effect.  The absolute mode (location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you touch/move the pen) of the pen takes a little while to get used to and I still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse.  But after a minute or so of using it, it comes pretty easily.  I think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet.It's fun to use too"
1363,electronics,"I'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuaI, and have owned several previous models of Wacom tablet. For the life of me, I just couldn't get the Graphire4 working on my Mac at all. The installer crashed (Kernal panic!) my otherwise rock solid Tiger installation. Downloading the latest driver from Wacom's web site was only marginally useful; the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how I adjusted the control panel, and even moderately fast motion caused it to ""submarine"" from one side of the screen to the other. Wacom's sparse FAQ suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit, and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away. It didn't work, and besides, I have no plans use the tablet from across the room.Phone support was no better: Wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff July 3rd off! Too bad, it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it. Looks like my trusty workhorse Intuos2 tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service, if this is the level to which Wacom's legendary tech support has fallen."

1373,electronics,"This adaptor is great, especially for the price.  Installation was as easy as it gets, right out of the box.  I had it up and running through a WEP-enabled local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes.  It locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection.  Both FrontPage and ClieMail ran fine.  Speed is maybe 80% of what I get on my laptop running a 333 MHz. Celeron and a PC card 802.11b adaptor.  Just be sure your PDA is on the (small) list of supported devices.Negatives: it's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world.  I wouldn't leave it in the Clie when not in use and I sure wouldn't want to drop it on the floor.It does chew through the battery, but not any more than the backlight.  I did a test with my UX40, with the backlight set at minimum (ie. not off entirely) and using CliePet's UnderClock app to slow it down to 96 MHz.  This is a good combination of power saving and usability.Then I got on the net and loaded pages non-stop.  Starting from a fully charged battery, it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm.  I was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that.  I consider that perfectly acceptable.  With an EB40 extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it.Overall, a great add-on for a fraction of the price of a UX50"
1374,electronics,"I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless:- It comes with a web browser that doesn't work.- Even if the browser DID work, it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version.- The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible).- The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail, software that comes with Internet-enabled CLIE devices... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card. These programs are not available separately.- The card wouldn't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors', even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either, no additional configuration required.- While attempting to connect, the card would often stop responding, and then lock up the handheld.Bottom line: if you want a web-enabled PDA, buy a web-enabled PDA. Don't buy this"
1375,electronics,"I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.#1 There is no case for the card.#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.Otherwise its a great little expansion card"

1402,electronics,"I have a Sony DVD player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time, and would still be good today if functioning. Recently however, it was seriously malfunctioning.  I would put a DVD in, and it would keep spinning, but then not recognize it at all. It would recognize and play CDs, but they would skip constantly. I decided to give this a chance for $5 to see if I could recover my player. I ran it once and it seemed to skip less, but would still not recognize DVDs.  I thought , maybe if I put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work.Voila!!! I couldn't believe it, DVDs were recognized and played again.  So give it a try, maybe run it a few times!!!"
1403,electronics,"My DVD player was ready to be thrown out, until I saw this product on amazon.  My DVD player wouldn't even load a DVD.  It kept saying ""please check disc"".

If you own a CDP/DVP/DVR a Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop......it certainly did in my case!!! Just my two cents.-paul"
1405,electronics,I like the use of this product. i think it did solve solve the problem my computer cd/dvd drive was facing which was slow reading the cds... with the low price its a must for every computer owner to use this
1406,electronics,"I purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows I couldn't wait to get my hands on one.Why wouldn't I? it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. At first it looked like a really cool product, and is, if your system is a Mac. Logitech has done a great job of selling the Nulooq to Windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on. There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product. I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech.What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users. So if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you....and I know where there is one for sale!!!"
1407,electronics,I love my tooldial and its' software.  My only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively.  I frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little.  Overall great product and I expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs.  Works very well in tandem with a WACOM tablet
1408,electronics,"Been waiting for the Windows version since I saw the product at PMA on Mac earlier this year.  Used the Windows version from the very moment it was available.  I touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great.  Tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end.  Adjusting brush size is the best.  Bracket keys never cut it for me.  I think the product does more, but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver.If you do touch up work in Photoshop all day long, this is a must have"
1409,electronics,"The NuLOOQ is an inexpensive and really fun way to fly through images in Photoshop when cloning out specks or needing to move throughout an image with lightning speed. The Pan/Zoom function is tremendous! It's a programmable tool where you can add photoshop tools and actions to the Tooldial for instant access at the mouse location, rather than moving to the menu bar all the time. This is a great time saver because you can program in redundant tasks to appear on the tool dial to be clicked in a moments notice.Changing brush size is as simple as turning the tool tuner to the appropriate brush size, in real time.I highly recommend it to speed and simplify one's workflow"
1410,electronics,"I bought a NuLOOQ when it first came out for the Mac. I've been an Illustrator  Visualization Artist for 17 years now. I have an iMac at home and a PC at my full-time job. It takes a little while to break some old habbits, but once you do, and get used to the NuLOOQ device, you'll never go back! I love this smart toy! I got so hooked on it, I recently purchased one for my PC here at work. If there is anyone out there that thinks it's just for the Mac your wrong! The PC version is just as good! It's become part of my left hand and I still use my Wacom tablet all the time also! To me, this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer; cross platform. Bravo to Logitech for making another great product! Get one...I'll guarantee you'll get hooked on it"
1411,electronics,Logitech scored a big plus with this item.  The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly.  The first review is really unfair.  Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous.  Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did.  Good job on this one. I recommend it highly
1412,electronics,"I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today.  One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week....  There may be a device out there that will someday ""revolutionize my workflow"", but this isnt it, Back it goes..."
1413,electronics,"I am a photographer whop purchased this for use in Photoshop.  It exceeded my expectations, and continues to amaze me daily.  I now use it for everything from my Safari Browser and iTunes to games.  It is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications!It is by far the most innovative product I have ever used...and the Tooldial software it comes with is AWSOME!"
1414,electronics,I bought this card reader in Feb. 2004 to use with SD cards.  Since then I have moved over to CF cards (Sandisk Ultra II's both 1 and 4 gig) and it has worked great every time
1415,electronics,I have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera.
1416,electronics,"I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.Not a quality reader.Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. ""Eject"" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader"
1417,electronics,"This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably.The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine.This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green).This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it"
1418,electronics,The Reader worked as advertised.  I'm very pleased with the purchase..
1419,electronics,This memory card reader worked like a charm for me.  We've used both SD and Sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems
1420,electronics,"The Sandisk reader is impossible to misuse. It loads quickly and it's compact shape offers most options for memory. It can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet. I would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn't move around on my desk so I'm giving it only 4 stars. If I had to replace this reader, I would buy another SanDisk"
1421,electronics,"The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....  Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments"
1422,electronics,"No problem reading and burning on NEC 2500A.  The media code is MCC which is highly rated in most media guides online (albeit not the best).  I also burn DVDs as slow as I can unless I am in a hurry, less chance for errors that way"
1423,electronics,I am very happy with these. They are fast and with very good qualit
1424,electronics,"I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturernever sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity"
1425,electronics,At least for my Sony DVD burner in my Powermac.  Completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot
1426,electronics,"Some of the worst DVDs that I have purchased. I wouldn't waste my money on any more of these POS discs. I wish I could return them to amazon, but for what I paid (it was pretty cheap), its not worth the effort."
1427,electronics,"I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media.I always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case. It takes longer, but I get good results. I am rarely in a hurry to burn a DVD.I would buy these again.** Updated on 7/3/2005 **I have bought a new computer recently and I have been burning these DVDs with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever. Very happy with this product"
1428,electronics,"If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star.  Media code: MCC 01RG20.  2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008"
1429,electronics,They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up).These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used.The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.I am going to return these package to Amazon. 
1430,electronics,No problems with this SanDisk.  I can take about 300 pictures from my Nikon camera.  Quality is perfect. 
1431,electronics,Good price. What else can one say about a Secure Digital Card
1432,electronics,"Excellent service from Amazon, Best quality in lowest price, I am really very happywith Amazo"
1433,electronics,"This is an excellent, reliable product. I bought 2 because of the outstanding sale price"
1434,electronics,"I love this 512mb SD card, its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a 1gig SD card too.works great with my GPS unit"
1435,electronics,"This card works great and is significantly less expensive than it is at local retail stores.  As a matter of fact, I just ordered another one yesterday"
1436,electronics,This sandisk digital card has been very useful and worked perfectly fine.Thank you
1437,electronics,"The card performs exactly the way that I expected it to, and I have had zero issues with speed downloading images from the care to my PC"
1438,electronics,You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store
1439,electronics,"I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it."
1440,electronics,"Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue"
1441,electronics,"Overall this is a very good remote.  It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled.  It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems.My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up.  These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices.  I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again"
1442,electronics,"Easy to use, and fairly easy to set up.  However, as stated in most previous reviews I read, initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use.  Wish that macro creation was more detailed; for example, more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a DVD, including ejecting and closing the DVD tray.  Pleased with purchase"
1443,electronics,Best remote product I ever purchased.  I have the older version of the Harmony and This newer version is 10 times better.  Lipo battery last for ever and you dont need to worry about it going dead because you charge it to much
1444,electronics,"This was a breeze to set up.  Just install the software on you computer, enter the model numbers of your components.  For those few items that aren't in the list, the 880 can learn from an old remote.  As a very nice bonus, if you don't have the old remote, the software will try to pick a device (example : you have an RCA tv Model XYZ , if model XYZ isn't in the list, it might suggest ZxY)  , and that suggestion should work. I liked how I could create a list of favorite channels, and how I could upload icons for those channels to the remote.    So that it shows the icon instead of the number.  Or better yet.  Open the icon in paint and in the icon put the number (the channel number right in/on the icon).  It looks good and works great!I love how the database for the IR codes for all the different devices can be added to by the users of the remote.  I understand that no company could ever hope to have ALL of the IR codes for ALL devices ever made.  To think that a company could do that would be insane.  Logitech realized there is power in numbers.  Let the end users help to improve things.  It also allows you to leave any components on permanently, for example my TIVO box.  I don't want that to turn off.  It can be turned off, and as a default the Harmony 880 will turn it off (to save power).  I prefer it on.  And making that change was pretty simple, you just go into the preferences for the TIVO (in the harmony software), and tell it ""Always leave this device on"".  Now when you hit the off button on the harmony remote, everything else turns off and the harmony 880 leave the TIVO on.My only complaints are these items: The buttons to the left and right of the screen are a little tough to push.   I personally think they should have been a little easier to activate.  Also I would have liked to have had the pause button a little more centered and more separated from the other buttons.  That way it would have been easier to pause a tv show/dvd/vcr tape.  And last but not least the Media and Device buttons should have been separated more from the left and right arrows that are just above those buttons.  It's a little tough to hit them without thinking about what you are doing.Given to have made the improvements I have just said would require adding a little width to the remote, but the trade off would have been for the better.  All in all I suggest the remote for anyone who has a number of components for their home theater.  It works wonders.  It might just be that I am a little to picky on my technology.  "
1445,electronics,easiest remote to program. has tremendous ability to tweek. will keep recommending to all my customers
1446,electronics,"I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database.  Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package.  In any event the process was hassle free and I  now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great.  (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.)  My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off.  However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again.  The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base.  Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880."
1447,electronics,"If you have basic PC skills this remote is for you.  With its USB connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it. The small LCD screen is very easy to set up and you. If your to lazy to customize your remote(me), it also has a learning port.  The learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one.  My favorite feature is turning everything on.  The button ""Play DVD"" turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv, additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres tv/video.  The only problem that I have with this remote is the recharge base.  It sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed on/off and gives off a beep.  All in all this is probably the best remote ive  ever had"
1448,electronics,"Great remote, does evertying I hoped and dreamed. The only downside was the set-up. Logitech went to great lenths to make the set up as simple as possible - unfortunatly that made the fine tuning of the remote a long process navigating a large number of learning steps. In the end I am very happy with the product and would suggest it to anyone - just put aside some time to get it to work exactly how you wish"
1449,electronics,"This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives ""HDD Error"" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer ""sees"" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again"
1450,electronics,"I had an iPod for about a year, and had a lot of problems with it, having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired.  After the third time, I sold it to a friend and invested in the iAudio instead.  This is a great product, as it can record sound, play movies, radio, and play tons of file formats.I highly reccomend this product, especially over the iPod...they are crap compared to this.  The only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts m4p files (songs from iTunes if you purchase music from them) as the iAudio can't read m4a or m4p.  It's easy enough to get a converter, just might cost you a little more money.Outstanding use of my money though....thumbs up"
1451,electronics,"I bought this player in December 2005,since then , this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well.I have no complaint about it, because I'm extremely dependent of this player, so that means that i use it, around 5 hours in my days off,and  2 hours in a regular day.Another example of how durable  this player is, because I like to exercise(running) with the music as my main powerï¿½ï¿½, therefore with the really hard to find function(anti-shock) in portable hard drives, the iaudio x5 is one the most functional PMP on the market.About the sound is just incredible clear with the right earphones.the unique complaint is about the non-sync with WMP,so I'm still waiting the right firmware...  As a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products."
1452,electronics,"I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works"
1453,electronics,"When I started looking for an mp3 player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level. The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I  didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects:-Superb sound quality, especially from something that weighs under 8 oz. (I am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable)-Rugged all metal construction and overall great feel-Simple design and intuitive joystick/buttons (I found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes; converts from the iPod may take some getting used to)-A plethera of options: mach3 bass, surround sound, pan, wallpaper, 5 band equalizer, fm radio, voice recorder, surround sound and MP enhance-The ability to play video-A 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time-Very powerful, I normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it-Priced about the same as equal or lesser mp3 players-Extremely easy program to use for transferring ANY type of file to the iAudio. It is a drag and drop system; it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music.-Everything you need is included in the box - earphones, usb 2.0 transfer cable, another cable, a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player, charger and jetshell software-Great storage space (20 GB) which can be used to store much more than mp3s There are some negative attributes to the iAudio X5 however:-The most glaring problem I had was with the in-ear headphones; they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable. They also have an assymetrical length cord. I consider myself to have average size ear canals so I imagine this is a major problem for other users. I suggest Cowon completely redesigns these.-Because the brand is widely unknown, the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews. -No place online to buy mp3s particulary for this player (however I read somewhere that there would soon be one just like iTunes.)This being my first mp3 player I am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price, because I would rather pay more for the quality. The iAudio X5 is an all around outstanding media player and I believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out. If I were to rate everything that came in the box I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones. Other than that this mp3 player is close to perfect."
1454,electronics,"I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat.  This is a quibble, however, that one can live with.  Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good."
1455,electronics,"After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on.I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending.I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port.What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market.A Satisfied Custome"
1456,electronics,"I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool.Absolutley buy this unit.  I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it"
1457,electronics,"I am not going to rehash what the other comments have said.  Most that mention pros and cons are accurate.  Here is my addition.  Joystick is not as good as the Ipod.  On the other hand, the Ipod was designed by Apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a PC.  I have not even installed any software to use my iAudio!  I use it as a hard drive, Mp3 player, and sometimes I record radio shows to listen to later.  I got the 30gb for extra storage.  The iAudio seems to be quality made and doesn't scratch as bad as my son's iPod.  I would buy this product if I had to do it all over again!   "
1458,electronics,"I bought this a few months back, and I use it mostly for playing WoW.PROS: Very high quality product, strong enough to endure long keyboard-smashing combat sessions. The LCD is very useful if [like me] you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game, because it allows me to control iTunes whithout alt-tabbing out of the full-screen game. Macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites, and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your in-game action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard (I use flexbar with WoW).CONS: The software needs a bit of improvement: If I put my computer to hybernate, the software seems to hang when I bring it back up, and I can't use the macro keys, so I have to reboot or kill the software's process and restart it manually. The interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability (it forces me to use the mouse a lot, and i like being able to use the keyboard). Even though the LCD offers other posibilities [like displaying available ammo], I don't use most of them, because I can get most of these values from my game's UI and I dont have to look away from the monitor to do so.Overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming. Wouldn't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming"
1459,electronics,"Overall, this keyboard is great.  Here are what I like about it:1.  I can fly on this key due to it's relatively soft keys (I think there are softer keyboards, i.e. less resistance when pressing down.  God, I miss my SPAR station keyboard, but can't use it with a PC :( )2.  LCD screen has huge growth potential for other info display.3.  lighted keys (this can be a bad thing too).4.  Programmable keys, lots of them!  (can be a headache to remember them too)The flaws:1.  The lighted keys uses a bright blue color, even at the dimmest setting it's still not good.  Here's some physics for the designers:The human eye doesn't sense blue well in the dark, and thus the pupil stays wide open, and the blue lights can be seen as a bad glare.  Same effect of having one of those expensive HID xeon headlights beaming at you.  So why is this a problem on a keyboard?  well, you would most likely use it in the dark with the key lights on.  However, your peripheral vision will have this blinding glare, it could make some people dizzy or have some optical illusion that's not going to sit well with your eye's scan rate.  Suggestion for the designer:  use other less intrusive color for the LED, possibly red, orange, green.  Hell, make them selectable!  Blue would not be my first choice.2.  The USB plugs on this keyboard doesn't support my USB 2.0 flash drive, BAD!!!!  If you are going to provide an USB port, do it right!3.  The black soft rubber surface on the edge and LCD back cover is a dust magnet.  They provide some good traction when you grab them, but they also grab dust like nothing else, so you'll endup with an impossible to clean black surface.  Lesson learned, don't eat snacks near the keyboard, or your keyboard will end up with lots of nice snacks for the dog to lick :D Ok, duck tape would fix that, but... I'm lazy!Other than that, it's a solid keyboard"
1460,electronics,"I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended"
1461,electronics,"I've had the Logitech G15 for several months now and it has many features which I use regularly. The paint doesn't seem to wear off even if I rub or scratch at the keys. Installation was somewhat time consuming because the keyboard has drivers for each part rather than one driver for the entire thing. Pros- Lights look great Screen is easily readable Third party LCD apps are highly customizable I can use chat on Trillian and access my buddy list with the screen. (Keystrokes go directly to the screen when you hit the button for reply, then I can send it by hitting enter) I can view a winamp visualization and song title, view my playlist, change various volume controls and use standard playback functions I can view network activity Macros are easy to program The key feel is awesome compared to my old keyboard. They have a nice solid click to them, but the pressure necessary and the keystroke length are both small.   Cons- Included LCD apps are terrible and useless to me Long setup More G-Keys than you'll ever use Minimal game support LCD apps take up valuable RAM (although not much) Keyboard profiler takes up RAM and must run to maintain full functionality Invisible lettering when the lights are off Light brightness levels are pointless. The options are: Off-can't see it! 1-Visable but dim. 2-Slightly more visible but still dim. USB ports are USB 1.1 ""Gaming mode switch""... I never hit the windows key while gaming even though I usually use ctrl and alt frequently. I think you'd really have to be fumbling with the keys to need that feature The wrist rest is flimsy The default LCD setting is to cycle through the APPS (which I hate) and if I don't shut down properly, the LCD profiler resets all its settings to default. The included POP3 checker doesn't have SSL, you need to get some ridiculous add on which sucks up more resources. The mail checker APP+ the SSL thing ends up being a little too resource heavy for me to appreciate. In other words, its a big pain to get Gmail working with the included checker.If you play a lot of World of Warcraft or really like to tweak your settings and streamline your interface, you might enjoy having all the macros. The screen is more useful for non-gaming purposes, so don't buy it with intent to improve your HL2 experience (since the LCD doesn't display anything for HL2 anyway). There are many 3rd party LCD apps out there and you can probably find one that will make you love the screen. Be warned, unless you use the 3rd party apps, you probably will be disappointed with the LCD's functionality. Bottom line- Recently the priced spiked up for these keyboards, I wouldn't pay the new higher price for one. This isn't the kind of item I would say that I can't live without. Its mainly a luxury, and unless you're a serious computer geek (like myself), you probably won't even know how to utilize the more advanced features.The hardware is solid and powerful if you know how to use it. The included software cd ended up in my trash can."
1462,electronics,Just like others have stated. The paint comes off the keys after a few months of use. You would think logitech would have made a better product.
1463,electronics,"This fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical ho-hum keyboard. The LCD screen is a nice feature (toy) but I find myself rarely using it as most apps and games don't support it. The two USB ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside USB on their towers. It is worth buying for anyone in that situation. The blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but doesn't help much in a truly dark room. The macro keys are plentiful and easy to use.All-in-all well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard, anyone needing easy access to USB ports and for anyone needing macro keys. People may also want to give the new Vista keyboard from Microsoft a look"
1464,electronics,"We bought this TV 3 months ago and don't regret it one bit.  It was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  We do not have satellite or cable (only reg. antenna) and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the ""digital"" signals.  Again, we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to HD"
1465,electronics,I searched far and wide and compared many tv's.  It came down to the Panasonic Plasma TV vs. the Sony KDFE42A10.  I went with the Sony due to price; but I'm glad I did.  I can't see putting [...]in a TV.  I am really pleased with the Sony; particularly the price I paid.  It was so much cheaper here at Amazon.com than at the big box retail stores
1466,electronics,"I purchased this television at a bricks-and-mortar store, on sale, for less money than the 32"" LCD screen that I was considering. I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV.For comparison, I am moving from a 26"" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great.My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault.I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200.My last ""pro"" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet. I can scoot this TV on my stand without scratching the wood surface, and when trying to center a TV which is nearly 40"" wide across the front, that's a good thing"
1467,electronics,I got mine locally for $1100 dollars.  The going rate was 1399-1599.  I saw it at a competitor for $1198.  So I went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another $100 off the price for HDTV installation.  What a picture.  I started to get turned off by sony because I had 2 32 inch CRT's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners.  But I remained loyal and I'm glad I did.  I was iniitally wanting a DLP by Samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away.  I didn't go for the $500 dollar service contract because that's half of the price of the television.  I'll take my chances on this one.  Hopefully bulbs will come down too.  You'll love the picture with or without HDTV.  I love all the features and they're pretty intuitive.  There probably won't be too many left.  I think they're phasing the model out.  Not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it.  Sorry about the other bad reviews here
1468,electronics,"I bought this TV in March of this year (2006) and it has worked perfectly until the Sony Techs came out and ""updated"" my firmware.  I was not having any problems with the TV but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty.  As soon as the tech left and I turned on the TV, the fan is running on ""high"" and is loud.  This did not happen until the software was updated.  I went into the functions and tried to use the High Alt function to turn the fan to low (off) but that would work.  The good news is I bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed, or replaced.........  Word of caution, you may consider not updating the firmware if the TV is working, and buy the extended warranty.  I paid $300 for 4 years and figure I'll get at least one $250 bulb out of the deal (yes, it is covered).  Otherwise, the TV is perfect"
1469,electronics,"I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran"
1470,electronics,"Well, I can't give an honest review of this product because I haven't yet received it.  I ordered it on June 15, and it was promised, by Amazon direct, not another seller via Amazon, between June 21 and June 23.  So I'm sitting here on July 15 with no TV.......It really isn't Amazon's fault, it's the shipper, Eagle.  But whatever, I'm less than satisfied with this Amazon.com transaction.  I have seen the TV in stores and it looks good though.................."
1471,electronics,"Brilliant images.  Highest quality.  You simply cannot beat this system for the price.  Also, this particular projection TV handles the non-HDTV channels very well - not all HDTV models do this.  The fact is that most channels are not available in HDTV yet, so it's nice to have a high quality TV that can deliver non-HDTV channels to you in a high quality rendering.  This TV does that very well.  Yes it's nothing like HDTV, but all the same they do a fine job with this model"
1472,electronics,"The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution"
1473,electronics,"We have the original Itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in. The originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station. After reading the instructions I plugged the new Itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals. Not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away. That is better than I expected after reading all the feedback. I'm not sure what everyones problem is. It's not a radio tower, it's a transmitter the size of your finger. I get the feeling that some people think it should power the City block."
1474,electronics,"I was a little tentative to order the iTrip LCD because of some of the bad reviews I read.  It seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item.  Buyers either love it or hate it.  I was leaving for a trip and hoped the iTrip would arrive so I could use it on my drive.  As luck would have it, it was in my mailbox the day before I left.  I unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it.  I plugged it into my 20GB iPod photo and right off the bat thought I had trouble.  It wouldn't power up, I tried plugging and unplugging, cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort, read the instructions.  After plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on.  This immediately explains why so many poeple complain of DOAs right out of the box.  I set the frequency to the lowest available on the FM band and presto!!! instant music.  I don't live in an extremely populated area so I can't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet.  Many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this.  It doesn't matter how great the quality of the song is on your iPod, you are playing it over FM radio so it will never sound better than FM radio.  I inherited my father's '91 Accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones AM/FM radio with a tone control(bass AND treble all rolled into one handy knob!!!) and cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers in the front doors.  When I drive I like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music.  The sound quality was exactly what I expected, no better and no worse.  I also tested it in my wife's '01 Focus.  It has a nice factory 6 speaker CD system and the sound from the iPod was just fine.  The bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all.  I am completely satisfied with the product.  One strange thing that I noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the iTrip, the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone.  If you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road.  Unless there was a defective batch sent out, I don't know where all of the complaints come from.  I got mine for $15 from a private seller on Amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money. Don't hesitate to buy one, it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is.  If you keep these things in mind, you won't be disappointed"
1475,electronics,it was not what i was expecting... but still ok... probably 96kbps... quality... still all right for the price... but if u want something with 320kbps quality... do not buy this product..
1476,electronics,"i was using the tape player for my ipod.  but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter.  i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency.  i was very very disappointed.  it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease.  i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear.  so i blame the transmitter.  i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it.  i'm glad target took it back. "
1477,electronics,"Some people seem to have had issues but I loved mine. I live in the Boston area and the iTrip always worked fine in the 88.3-88.5 range. Not fantastic sound but more than adequate. The portability is a huge plus as well - I used it for playing my iPod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling, radios at friends' houses, on and on.  The iTrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable. I have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently.For the price and the convenience you can't beat this thing.The only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of iPods"
1478,electronics,"I purchased 1 of the old model when I bought my ipod. As hard as I tried I was unable to switch stations on it. ""Okay"" I thought, ""I must have got the one bad one..."" So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the ""radio stations"" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are ""just not tuned in right"" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the ""station fuzz"" goes away. Only a fool walks on thin ice twice - and I've done it 3 times now...Never again! Don't follow in my footsteps! Please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage"
1479,electronics,It's goo
1480,electronics,I've used this to burn about 3 CDs and my husband has done a couple as well.  We haven't had any problem so far
1481,electronics,It was a  little complicated to install (but I'm not very technical) but it is very easy to use - I have been happy with it
1482,electronics,"I bought this about 7 months ago and never had a problem with it. It take 7 minutes to burn an 80 minute cd. The program reminds you to close any other open programs before burning a disc, very easy to use. I brun cd's every single day. It is my baby!!"
1483,electronics,"It is an excellent product, easy to install, really powerful, the only minus is the burner software, if you have or you can purchase Nero or CDRWin then you can obtain the maximum performance from this unit"
1484,electronics,"I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message ""PROTECT UNPLUG"".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.  First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an ""Eject"" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.  Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.   "
1485,electronics,"I bought this ""dream system"" to compliment my Samsung HL-R5087W 50"" HDTV DLP television.  If looks could kill these two products together win hands down.  Overall I am pleased with the system for the amount of money I invested for it.  Sound is decent.  I feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with Monster Cables.  As like many others thoughts I was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and ""wireless"" seemed to be the answer.  Problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a WIRE.  So if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because Sony has figured out how to eliminate point A to point B but point B to point C remain dreamless"
1486,electronics,"This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32"" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars"
1487,electronics,"This product is awesome....of course, it's a Sony :)What else can I say"
1488,electronics,"I started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment. A wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my TV. After searching for a while, there were only a couple options available: the Sony DAV-FX100W, a system by Panasonic that had an optional wireless option, and a wireless receiver kit made by Kenwood. After looking at reviews of all of the different options, the Sony DAV-FX100W appeared like the best choice. I'm very happy with that decision. DVDs look great on my HDTV with the 1080i upscaling feature. Be forewarned, if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive HDMI cable and your TV will need to be support it. I bought a 3ft Belkin cable (instead of Monster) and it was still over $100. DVDs also sound terrific; the surround is impressive for a wireless solution. Like any stereo, it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker, and I pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel. The subwoofer, as others have stated, is pretty powerful for a passive speaker. There could be more depth to the sound, however, it is an out of the box solution and I think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it's default sound level. Others have complained that CDs don't sound good; I disagree. I've played several CDs and I think they sound great. I also input my iPod through the Video1 audio inputs, and that sounds pretty great too. Again, like any receive, you'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking. Overall, I'm very happy with this system"
1489,electronics,"I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one.  Some Dream System.  The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well.  After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas.  I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!!  And i haven't even watched a movie ye"
1490,electronics,"I purchased the Sony DAV-FX100W system over the internet.  It surprisingly arrived in only a few days. Assembly and wiring instructions were done well.  It looks good and matches well with my Sony HDTV.  The sound quality is just fine for movies and TV programs but fair at best for listening to music on CD's or from the FM tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo.  The base is not tight and kind of whoompy, although there is plenty of it.  I actually had to decrease it by 3 db.  The many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the ""sport"" which does sound like being in a stadium.  Most of the time it is best in ""auto"" performing in the method the audio was recorded.  The IR transmitter/receiver works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as AC power for the amp, a wire from the IR receive to the amp, and wires from the amp to both rear speakers.  Not as clean as one might imagine from the product description.  As mentioned in previous reviews, the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack.  A 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with DVD's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple CD's to listen for music.  I certainly would prefer my stereo for that!Over all I am satisfied with it and recommend it.  It performs well for what it was intended, to reproduce sound from movies and TV.  Again it is a good looking system."
1491,electronics,"Well, I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $149..I love mine... The sound really is great, and the price was AWESOME!  I use mine for DVD's, my TV's regular sound for all TV I watch, and also as a Tuner to listen to the radio/ CD's in surround sound.  Some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers...  I don't know if this helps or not, but I will share- I had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and I did NOT put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit.  I thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference, so if you have that whine, make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment.  Mine does not make any noise on standby, or skip at all either.  I am very happy with mine."
1492,electronics,"I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar"
1493,electronics,"The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer.  The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem.  Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit.  I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service"
1494,electronics,"This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room.  Assembly takes about two minutes.  The instructions are very clear.  The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film.  Why then do I give it one star?It skips.  Like nobody's business.  At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched.  But then we put in new disks.  No difference.  When exactly does it skip?  Impossible to tell.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes every frame!  Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad.  Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.Save your money!  Buy from someone else"
1495,electronics,"I puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance. The DVD playback is fantastic - you really feel the surround sound - and the speakers work well. It can get pretty loud too.The only minor issue I have is when I'm in ""TV"" mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low. I've experiemented with all of the modes but can't seem to be able to get them up to the volume I would like. This is not a problem when playing a DVD or using the radio tuner, however.Set up was extremely easy and a complete ""no-brainer"".Great system for a great price"
1496,electronics,this dvd system is sweet the sound system is off the hook its worth your  Doller
1497,electronics,This home theater system is great! It was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions. Once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear. Highly recommended for the price you pay
1498,electronics,the item ordered performs well in what it is supposed to do
1499,electronics,Great item for homes lacking phone jacks. Easy to set up.Better than trying to hard wire
1500,kitchen_houseware,"I have an old beagle who decided in her dotage that she would bark when ever she didn't get her way, she was becoming intolerable, barking at all hours of the night, disturbing everyone around. She is extremely fragile, with a heart condition, and I felt a shock collar could kill her. I will admit I was very skeptical about this spray collar but I was desperate, anyone who has owned a beagle will know that they are difficult at best to train.    So  I tried the collar, and I am very happy to report it works, Tallys barking has returned to its normal level,which was infrequent, it happened quickly, within a few days, we followed the directions on the box, which are very important, and had good results. I can't promise this will work for every dog, but it worked well for ours,without resorting to shocks. I don't think you can just hang this collar on your dog and expect it to work, although I do ocassionaly with Tally to refresh her training, I feel it is very important to do the training outlined in the instructions, and you will get results fairly quickly. I am quite satisfied with this product"
1501,kitchen_houseware,"The Premier collar was the best solution to help my dog restrain from barking without any injury to him!!  He learned within a few days while on walks to stop barking at other dogs, when wearing the collar.  I didn't want to use the shock method, but my groomer told me about the Premier Citronella collar to aid in his training.  We got good results!"
1502,kitchen_houseware,"My grandma's 10 year old Yorkie just would never shut up.  He barked at our cat, at our parrot, and anything that moved really.  We bought this collar, and it worked perfectly and immediately.  One bark and it sprayed, and he would go running off...and stop barking!  I felt kinda bad for him, but his reaction was hilarious.  I couldn't stop laughing at him, poor thing.  However, he did learn that if the collar wasn't on, he wasn't going to get sprayed, so he would bark"
1503,kitchen_houseware,"I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a ""blue juice special"". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money"
1504,kitchen_houseware,"I have purchased a total of three of these collar. They seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate. Then, after a few months, they quit working altogether. I check the charge and the batteries and that's not the problem. I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs"
1505,kitchen_houseware,"I thought I'd give this a try for my yappy chihuahua mix.  I did not want to try a shock collar, but I was concerned that this collar would be too large for her (she's only 8 lbs).  Although it looks a little large, she doesn't appear uncomfortable at all.  And WOW did this work!  The spray stopped each barking episode on the first bark - immediately.  After the first 2-3 days,  she is barking less in general and doesn't have to wear the collar all that often.  It's been 5 days, and I don't think she will need to wear it forever.  This product has been a total lifesaver, and my dog is happy too. "
1506,kitchen_houseware,"This is a great product. We have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people, kids, bikes, dogs and pretty much anything. We use the collar on him maybe 2 times and now he hardly ever barks in the car. We still use the collar once in awhile. We are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach. So far we like it a lot"
1507,kitchen_houseware,"This item did not work when I got it.  I returned it to Zelco, who informed me that it was my error, they did not do refunds, and returned it to me.I had a previous model Zelco that worked great for 10-15 years.  It had a switch.  This new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off.Gr"
1508,kitchen_houseware,"I've used the Itty Bitty Booklight for years.  The 2nd edition is a welcome improvement.  It's much easier to turn on/off, and the light stays in place after months of use.  (The light on the Original Model tends to swivel after time."
1509,kitchen_houseware,"Dear Customer Service,I am please about the refund; I am please about all thinks that I purchase from you.The web page where I bought: Zelco ""itty bitty"" Book Light, Volume 2 I believe is not clear.By looking the page I had the impression that I was going to buy a mini lamp where I was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a LED lamp. At list this was my impression.Sincerely,Adrian"
1510,kitchen_houseware,"I am looking for a new book light, and as a former owner of this light, I was suprised at the bad bulb stats.  This bulb, like halogen bulbs, get very hot.  It is imperative that you do NOT touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it.  The oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp. and hastens failure.  Hope this help"
1511,kitchen_houseware,"Light is beautiful and functional, and so great for traveling, but first LED light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months.  Too bad."
1512,kitchen_houseware,"I actually purchased this book light so that I can read while I wait for my child to sleep.  he likes me to be in the room.  This was perfect.  Does not put out enough light to bother my son, but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while I wait for him to fall asleep"
1513,kitchen_houseware,"I own two that include the ac adapter.  They are great bright lights.  I used the first one so much that it sometimes slides closed too easily.  Replacement bulbs are not hard to find.  Don't bother paying for high priced Zelco bulbs.  I bought my generic replacements at Walmart in the area they sell flashlights.I use rechargeable batteries.  They probably last 8-10 hours on a fresh charge, maybe longer.  I've had to use one as a substitute dome light when in a vehicle for an extended period.  I put it on the visor.The lights are very bright.  In some circumstances they might be too bright, but that would be a weird complaint for a light, huh"
1514,kitchen_houseware,"This book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person.  I use it with the converter so I can plug it into the wall , but the battery adapter works well for travel.  I have also used it to read in the car. I wish the wiring was a little heavier, as this was where my former light failed, but it lasted for several years with regular use"
1515,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this light for my wife several months ago.  There have been absolutely no problems, and it even seems to be holding up better than my original itty bitty book light.  I would get this one for myself if I decide to get another one, but I'm also checking out the flourescent one, which is supposed to never need a new bulb, and you can hardly find the bulbs for the regular ones anymore, unless you go to Zelco's website"
1516,kitchen_houseware,"O.K., buy this poster if you like spooky things but don't say you were not warned. You are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around.This is a good poster for both movie poster collectors and those familiar with the books. The movie encompasses several of the first books of the series. And the poster is indicative of both.You will need room to display this 27 x 40 poster. I suggest getting a side panel from a refrigerator delivery box. Placing it in a poster frame will prevent it from getting any bite marks."
1517,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this bark stop because my neighbor has a pit bull that stays out 24/7 barking, and the shared fence is about 15 feet from my bedroom window.  The dog barks so loud, there is no where in my house that I can retreat to for silence.  I bought this super bark stop in hopes of quieting the dog.  The dog is so stupid that it barks even more when the noise starts up.  So we turned the volume up so that the neighors hear it too.  That's what did it.  As soon as the dog started barking and the alarm sounded, the dog was brought in.  That was until the neighbor broke it with a broom stick so we are buying another one.  Too bad for them"
1518,kitchen_houseware,"PEACE AT LAST!!!!! We have only had this for 4 days, but we are very happy. I ordered this because of RUDE neighbors who leave there 2 dogs(who bark and bark and.... they don't stop) out 24/7 is a dog run outside our bedroom window. Other neigbors have complained as well, they still won't do anything. After setting up the bark stop it didn't take long before they got the idea, they get 1 or 2 barks out then nothing :) I called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs ""trying to bark"" I told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it, she thought that was great.( now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard)update 10/18 okay the real test came last night and again this morning.What was the test?? SIRENS!!! I just had to laugh, they couldn't bark and howl!!! All I heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them. I am so glad we bought this!!!!"
1519,kitchen_houseware,"Not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs, but the company also refused to provide a refund/replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing.  After sitting out in a rainstorm, the Super Bark Stop shorted out and is now totally worthless.  Find another product - You'll thank me later"
1520,kitchen_houseware,"Like many people, I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such, they still have no concern for the noise pollution. I was losing sleep, and the barking was getting so bad that I even considered moving! In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money.WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...?It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately. It's as if it's afraid to bark. YAY!You can select the volume, tone, and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say, from talking or loud bird squawking). Audible and inaudible both work fine, but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting.The device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 D batteries (not included) to operate it. I am SO thankful we found Super Bark Stop! My nerves were really getting jangled and I was dreading early mornings, when they put the mutt outside. It's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean I want saddled with its noise while you neglect it!P.S. After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer. The person I bought it from said that ""once it's opened, we find that it's not 100% waterproof"". Well guess what? You gotta open it to put the batteries in it! Either buy a faux bird house to protect Bark Stop or house it where it won't get wet. Otherwise, you may find yourself in the same position we were in. We got a refund, and fortunately for us, our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one"
1521,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor's mutt.  The offending dog is often left on the neighbor's porch, where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by.Before ordering, I had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect.  In my case, the neighbor's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine.  Unfortunately, this was not ""too close for comfort"" as far as the dog was concerned.Having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices, I was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working.  Alas, it did not.  Some dogs just don't hear them.  In my case, it was probably due at least in part to the distance.My suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target.  If it doesn't work, go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what I did).  By the way, you don't need an RA (AKA RMA) number to return the device.  Just send it to the company along with your receipt, and a note saying that you would like a refund (not an exchange).(...)  I sympathize with anyone having this problem, and wish you all the best of luck.  No one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason, and the argument that ""dogs bark"" simply does not hold any water"
1522,kitchen_houseware,"Glad to see they still make this clock.  Yea, the parts are simple but I love the way it looks on on my wall.  I even changed the dots when I moved.  It used to be on a white wall, now it looks even COOLER in my new place w/ my own white dots on a GLASS wall.  The one I had for 10+ years just died.  I'm ordering another one.  Hopefully, it'll last as long"
1523,kitchen_houseware,"Clock is smaller than I thought, and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall.  Made of cheap materials, definitely not worth $25"
1524,kitchen_houseware,"I set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell, I have 3 dogs, I put it on and they went beserk, they started going after each other, I didn't hear anything myself, but I am quite sure the dogs did, like I said they acted very badly towards each other, the tone must have made them lash out like that. I cannot use it anymore."
1525,kitchen_houseware,I picked this up after reading the 50/50 reviews.  One of our dogs ran over to it and jumped up to see what it was as it buzzed away.  The other just wandered around and took no notice.  Neither seemed scared/bothered at all.  This product had zero affect on our dogs' barking.  I'm going to return it
1526,kitchen_houseware,"I have a 3 1/2 year old Boxer that barks, cries, whines, and howls when I go to work...ALL DAY...I know, I recorded it.  I went to Petsmart and picked up this gadget.  Brought it home and it the manual correct button.  She bolted.  She hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes.  It reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and I don't crate my dog when I'm going to be away for more than 8 hours.So if I'm just running out for a few hours I stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if I'm going to work I use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar.My girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it.  Worth the price in my opinion.  Best advice is to take it home and try it.  Some dogs react to it.  Others don't"
1527,kitchen_houseware,"My beagle (13 mo.) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time.  Does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks, not smaller barking or any form of whining (even if extremely loud)"
1528,kitchen_houseware,I have a very actiuve Border Collie and she had a tendency to bark at anything! I tried all the training methods I could find and nothing worked. I then purchased a Citronella spray gadget ($$$) which did nothing. (I think she liked the perfume.) I was contemplating with great reluctance one of those electrical shocking devices ($$$$) but just in time my nephew lent me his Dazzer and within 2 days i have a rarely barking dog. I can't recommend it enough
1529,kitchen_houseware,"Dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them.  The device I received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity, some don't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them.  I had a chance to try a different brand years ago and I know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison.  If you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten.  There you go, suicide by dog, that's a good use for it.  May be it is just quality control, you might get lucky,  if not then you might have to deal with a seller that won't return calls or e-mail, like i did.  So you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad.  Go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones.  I hate being cheated.  Score another point for the bad guys"
1530,kitchen_houseware,"it requires effort from owners.  Bought this to help control our Sheltie's barking behavior.  When we first tried it, he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from.  We noticed that this alone wouldn't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'No' or 'Quiet'. This  meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much.  They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands.  So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here.Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either.  My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean.  Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order. My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention.My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself.   Not sure I would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on walks..just in case. "
1531,kitchen_houseware,I have a very hyper mini schnauzer and i thought that i could control her aggressive barking and yapping.  It is very out of control and this device didnt help at all. I know am purchasing a tritronic no bark shock collar.  A friend has one and recommended it to me.  They are 99 dollars but this is 25 and not worth a dime to me. The dazer does get animals attention for a while but they soon get use to it and then all you can do for it to be effective is to throw it at them.
1532,kitchen_houseware,"Purchased to replace our constantly broken intercom system. Installation is a matter of pushing a button so even I was able to do it and I love the fact that I can carry the station to the washer or outside... wherever.  We also bought the outdoor station and put it at the front. Now when I'm outside, I don't have to worry about not hearing the doorbell"
1533,kitchen_houseware,"I have ordered this unit twice this past month, the first one did not work properly in one of the units, the signal was distorted. After returning it to the supplier, I ordered it again from another Amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all. I will now look for another brand"
1534,kitchen_houseware,The unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface.  100ft. would be pushing it
1535,kitchen_houseware,"I bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. The manual is not thorough, but it does tell you AFTER you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an AC adapter.  I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit. Also, the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. The sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off, but the units are far from user-friendly."
1536,kitchen_houseware,I think this is a greater product. Unlike other intercom systems I've bought this one is wireless and the sound is clear
1537,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this for Mother's Day for my Mother and Mother in law and they both have said that they are still going strong.  I was a little skeptical at first but they came though.  Oh and for the other reviewer who wrote they are cheaper on Wal-mart is correct but shipping is almost $20, so this is a better deal by far!  I liked this so much i am sending it to someone else"
1538,kitchen_houseware,This is a very beautiful flower which has wonderful aroma. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to all people who value charming plants. It would make a great gift as well
1539,kitchen_houseware,"Sent to my daughter in CA for her birthday. She loves the gardenia. The service was excellent. Thanks to Frances, Emily and My-An"
1540,kitchen_houseware,"I received great customer service and a beautiful plant here.I would recommend this Gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift.My Gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition, is still very healthy, and smells terrific.I've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said ""what smells so good grandma?"
1541,kitchen_houseware,"If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product"
1542,kitchen_houseware,"I have a hefty tortoise-shell Manx who is constantly shedding.  I saw the commercial for this product, and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals, and just had to have one.  Boy, was I ever disappointed!  When I try to brush my cat with it, the teeth just float on top of her hair... they don't even go down into the undercoat.  Maybe it's because she's chubby, I don't know, but it sure doesn't work for her.  I'm left handed, so I had to turn the blade the other way on the handle.  Maybe I'm not using it right.  I'm still very disappointed.  The animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them"
1543,kitchen_houseware,"i got this for my cat (ocicat breed).  he's a short-haired cat that doesn't generally need much grooming except when the season changes.  shedender worked just like the commericals.  one brush and fur goes flying everywhere.  it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back.  as u can see in the picture the tool is small.  if you have the patience and extra time (and if your pet has the patience too!) u can think about saving some money with this tool.  if you want something more efficient, invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead.  i bought both and compared them but i'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price"
1544,kitchen_houseware,"My three year old med-length hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush. She gets persistent dandruff and furballs but won't let me touch her with any other brush. I have tried about every kind of brush but she hates being groomed! So imagine my surprise when I pull this brush out of the package and she actually lays down for me to groom her after a few strokes! The only downsides to this product are:1. the small size - it doesn't hold much fur so either all the fur ends up on the floor or you are emptying it every few strokes2. the ""front"" versus ""back"" positions - cats do not generally stay in one place, I have three and they roll and walk around while I groom them. It was a bit unconvenient to constantly switch the brush from my left to right hand to get the proper angle to de-shed my kitties. I don't know how this could be improved but it is a downside to the product.Overall it's defineitely worth the 10 bucks I spent, my Boo-boo never lets me groom her with anything else"
1545,kitchen_houseware,"The way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use.  I would get the Furminator instead, it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes!  This technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove"
1546,kitchen_houseware,"This product does what it claims.  I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well.  The downside of the product is the size.  It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it.  They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more.  I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator.  I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal.  It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat"
1547,kitchen_houseware,"I just received this product today, and I already love it.  I ordered it for my cats.  It works as great as they said it would"
1548,kitchen_houseware,I have a long haired Ragdoll cat.  He is a constant shedder.  My husband saw this and bought it for me.  My cat hates being brushed so that is the challenge. But when I do it you can see the difference.  I end up with a pile of fur and a much shinier cat. He doesn't seem to like it but he will escape for any brushing so I think that's just him.  Having to go only one direction is a bit hard because the cat is so stubborn but I can see the difference around my house. I used to have to clean the furniture daily with a roller and now it is every few days days and no where near the amount of hair that used to get on there! I recommend this for any long haired animal!
1549,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this bookstand at the beginning of 1L after a lengthy search and lots of testing. This bookstand is metal, and it has a rubber serrated grip to hold the base of a book in a variety of positions.  For me, this is a key feature b/c I use the bookstand at many different locations, and I use desks and tables of different heights.  I adjust the main angle w/ the stand in the back, and furtther adjust the book's angle by wedging the spine into a rubber slot at the base.I should note two other benefits.  First, for a year and a half I've put 1200 + page casebooks in this book stand and it's never bent; and I can get the spines of those casebooks to flatten out with the stabilizer arm.  Huge ++.  Second, I can lean into my casebooks and write in the margins.  This bookstand support my upperbody weight.  I don't think you'll find a plastic stand, or a wire stand, that will do that.In sum, if you're in law school, this stand will be your best friend.  Your neck muscles will appreciate the investment"
1550,kitchen_houseware,"After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs.  Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was.  This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back.  Any of my school books are not stably supported.    I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages.  Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00).  Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you. "
1551,kitchen_houseware,"This book stand is an absolute necessity if you're a college student, and even if you're reading for leisure. I love having my hands free to drink a coffee or snack, or anything else I want to do."
1552,kitchen_houseware,"After recently returning to school, I was quickly reminded how tough reading textbooks is on one's neck, especially while trying to take notes at the same time. After looking at several other book stands, this seemed to be the best choice. I haven't had any trouble with my textbooks - both hardcover and softcover. Even if you're not experiencing neck pain from reading, it's a good idea to create a more ergonomic study space for yourself. It also should be especially useful for those working on smaller desktops that need to have a notebook or binder open as well. I'm sure this stand could also be useful when retyping documents as well"
1553,kitchen_houseware,"After reading the one review on this site I ordered the bookmateand eagerly awaited it as I was using a Fellowes plastic bookstand for my softcover textbooks.  When it arrived I was sorely disappointed.  The back support for the book measures only about 7""x7"" and the depth measurement for the book is 1"".Any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7""x7"" is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand isn't big enough.  In addition, because the depth is only 1"", forget any book with say over 500 pages.  At least the Fellowes stand has a back support of 12"" x 9"", its deficiency is its page holding arms.  I can't see how anyone using a an average sized cookbook, as perhaps this amazon category is targeted, could use this bookmate usefully"
1554,kitchen_houseware,"I first bought one of these at Barnes  Noble, or maybe through Levenger about 5 years ago, lost it traveling and spent hours and hours and hours searching the web, going to stores etc. looking for another one, but it was out of production.  I bought other book stands in the interim, and looked at countless pictures of others but none came close to the simplicity and effectiveness of this little guy.  Tne design is near perfect.It folds up, so you can flatten it  stick it in your book.  It has little feet that hold the pages of even a realy thick paper back down.  It's flat surface balances on just about anything (I balance it on a pillow when I'm reading in bed).  It adjusts to different angles.  It's is a near perfect design.I've given this as a present and the response is always the same - ""How did I ever live withouth this?""If you're a reader, DO NOT HESITATE.  My motive for encouraging you?  If more people buy them, they'll never go out of production and I won't have to worry about losing mine ever again.Absolutely essential for readers."
1555,kitchen_houseware,"In principle, this should be a great product.  We got one and set it up in a few seconds.  Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking.  (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.)  Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit.  That one worked great...for 5 days.  Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund.That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer.  Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer"
1556,kitchen_houseware,We have large dogs who are so sweet but end up barking at noisy neighbors with children playing in the field behind our home and a neighbor next to us who is always complaining about our dogs barking so we decided the best thing would be to buy a bark curbing device.  We ordered the Bark Stop Pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking.  We were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we're very thankful that this device works.  You have to use the high frequency for the big dogs.  We would recommend this product to anyone who has a large barking dog
1557,kitchen_houseware,"It appears that the Viatek product (Bark Stop Pro) is related to the Lentek design (PC16 ; ASIN: B0002Q89O6) - they are based on a common design by a Lentek engineer. I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer of the Lentek PC16 who noted that the unit only works on the ""Audible"" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ""Ultrasonic"" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc. This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. I've tried two different units and they both do NOT work. The negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks."
1558,kitchen_houseware,"I bought the bark stop about 2 weeks ago. I had read several reviews either really good or really bad so I was quite skeptical, but my dog (jack russell terrier) would bark at the rays of sunlight coming into the house, so I was desperate.The most important thing to remember when buying a product like this is that there aren't many things that are both great and easy. When you buy treats for dog to train him, do you simply leave the treats out all the time. No. Because he would never figure out that the treats were a reward for doing what you wanted him to. It's the same thing with the bark stop.The first thing you should do with this device is put it to the audible setting and then test and see what makes the bark stop actually go off. I found that doors shutting hard, clanging dishes, etc all set it off. So, if the device goes off every 5 seconds, the dog isn't going to think for a second that it's going off because he's barking. He's going to assume that it's a uncontrollable sound that he has to live with.So after putting the device back into the ultrasonic sound setting, I decided that I would only plug the device in when the dog was barking or when he was in his cage. Also, I never leave the device plugged in when I'm doing dishes slamming doors, or doing loud things. So the dog only hears the device when he barks. I realize that this might be a slight annoyance to walk on egg shells in order to make sure the device works, but I would rather do that than have a barking dog. The way I look at it, is I wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats in the middle of his training, so why leave it plugged in all the time.In the end, the first time I plugged in the bark stop, I let the dog bark it out. He barked for about 5 minutes (normally 10-15) and then stopped. The second time I plugged it in, he didn't bark more than twice. The bark stop puts out a ultrasonic beep when you plug it in, so I think that now he knows when he's going to hear more than he wants to. I think that the dog has now gotten more used to it, and will try to out bark it, but for the most part, he doesn't bark much at all while it's on, if he barks at all. The one thing that the manual does say is that if the dog is trying to protect the house, usually this device won't help, which I think is a good thing.Cons:When I was testing the microphone (used for taking in the bark loudness) on the device, it didn't seem to matter if the microphone was on high or low. Also, this device would be so much more useful if it came with a remote to turn on or off, not to manage each bark, but to simply be able to sit at the couch and click it on, or to click it off"
1559,kitchen_houseware,"The item didn't work at all.  As a matter of fact.  My dog didn't even flinch when I tested it right next to her head.  No, she's not deaf either.  We yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine.The item actually melted in the sun (it still worked though).  I was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun - oh well - lesson learned.I'm not trying to sound bitter but don't waste your money on this item.  I'm gonna try the shock collar next.  Maybe I'll have better luck.Thanks anyways,Mik"
1560,kitchen_houseware,"I found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate.  It's a soft light (almost seems like a natural spectrum) and is very directed at the page.  The clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover, and the neck is flexible as needed.  So, functionally, it gets a solid A.But I wasn't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries (two of those round watch/calculator batteries).  Replacing them is a hassle (though inexpensive) because I have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before I leave, and I have to find them in a store with an electronic department.  I wish this light took AAA or something.The light does include batteries, so you won't need to worry until you run out.  For me, that was  probably around 20 hours or so"
1561,kitchen_houseware,"Very nice and handy product, I whish the light was little bit more and brighter"
1562,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased this gaming/entertainment center for my son when he was only 3.  He has a 13"" TV/VCR and an original Nintendo system with lots of games.  I thought this item would be a great addition to his room because it is sturdy plastic, easy to put together or move, and holds everything I needed it to.  This item is not something an adult would want to have in his/her living area, like one of the reviews I read.  I mean Step2 is a company that makes a lot of products for kids.  Anyway, my son loves this product, and so does his 2 year old brother"
1563,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room.  He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a ""20 inch"" TV.  If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!!  I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!! "
1564,kitchen_houseware,"Man this item is fantastic. I love wasting $80 on pointless furniture. Getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems.... Man I must be in heaven. Not only that but it breaks easily, does this thing have no limit? So I bought this great video center around a year ago.... And what happens it breaks. I had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap. It looks like you're in a baby kids room. Similar to those play centers in day cares or McDonalds. Man that is lame.... I just love having children decor in my house, and it has to be $80. If I were you.... I would just let my systems, TV, and CDs sit in some tubberware. Believe me it would be 50X safer!"
1565,kitchen_houseware,i bought this video center for my son for christmas as well a ps2 to store and at first i did not think that it would fit in the drawer part but it did but the ps2 games do not fit on the top left and right slots because of the length of the games however they do fit on the sides where you would put the vhs tapes and that is where my son has added his games so you would have to be a little creative with it. i had seen a review where a lady had bought this item for her son and she was very disappointed once she could not place the games in the slots and stated not to purchase. everyone out there! do not listen to that its a must have and it does help with organizing your room area! and the price at the time during the holiday season i could not resist for $71.99 plus free shipping! WOW!
1566,kitchen_houseware,We thought this was very handy storage.  It holds all our video equiptment just right
1567,kitchen_houseware,"This looks like a great organizer, but with you people that have a x-box ps2 game cube and a dvd player you can buy cd cases that music cds come in and place the ps2 xbox and game cube games in those along with the dvds. It would be a bit of money depending on how many games and dvds you have though.."
1568,kitchen_houseware,"I was very excited when the box first arrived at our doorstep.  My eight year old son and I managed to get the unit put together, after a little tugging to get some of the screws to go into place.  We carried it up to his room, and put the T.V. and V.C.R. into place.  My excitement turned to bitter dissapointment, however, when I tried to fit my son's PS2 games into the shelves desighned to hold CD's or VCR tapes.  The PS2, and DVD cases are too big to fit into these slots. I had just not realized that they would not work with this model. The whole reason I ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room, so this will not work for me. I will probably try to return it, and order the newer model"
1569,kitchen_houseware,"I gave this to my neighbor across the street who said he'd tried everything on his dog and had decided she was just a ""barker.""  It worked immediately and completely. (I would only use it in ultrasonic mode because the audible mode will further annoy your neighbors.)Before I found this device I used a hose on a dog who barked under my window at various times of the night during the summer.  I had to squirt the dog 3 or 4 times for a couple of nights and then the dog shut up.Dogs should sleep in the house at night.  "
1570,kitchen_houseware,"I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard.  This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog.  I could detect no effect whatsoever.  Save your money, and try something else.  I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking"
1571,kitchen_houseware,"I used to live in a quiet neighborhood with three yappy Australian Shepherds, one of them next door, and two more on the other side of it (so they were two doors down from me).  I was skeptical, but the dog were driving us nuts.  I installed a Bark Free (before the Super model was released), and the dogs quickly learned to shut up.  It was remarkable.  They would still bark once or twice if they got super-excited, but it stopped nearly 100% of their bored ""I wish someone would let me exercise"" barking.  I only considered using the Ultrasonic mode.My only other word of advice is that a competitive product, the Dog Silencer Pro, is a worthless piece of garbage, and even in ""Ultrasonic"" mode, it produces a piercing screech heard by everyone, including humans.  Avoid that one at all costs"
1572,kitchen_houseware,"We bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously. I confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking, he told me if I had a problem with his dog barking to call the police, I did! He tried to have a restraining order put on us so we couldn't call the police, the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet, which he never did. So when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic. The dogs kennel is about 7ft from my garage where I hung it. The barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be. I have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also,apparently they don't like to hear it ! Too Bad, so sad! The dog gets used to it so every once in a while I unplug it for a day or so. When it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking. Plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference. It has really helped us where the neighbor wouldn't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking "
1573,kitchen_houseware,"I was sleepless and willing to try anything.  I mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor's back porch, where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly.  Despite all my hope, I couldn't detect any change in barking with this device deployed.  In fact, I had to abandon that side of the house until I hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog"
1574,kitchen_houseware,"the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more...anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money..."
1575,kitchen_houseware,"I had so many barking dogs that I was feeling like shooting them. My rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog's disruption of the neighborhood (some kind of power thing I guess). When ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill. When my last short term renter (a pastor) yelled NO! at them I became desperate. I had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs. I was looking for a new collar (cironella) I plugged in anti bark, and then up popped this Super Bark Product. I bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree. The dogs barked the entire time right at the fence, until my daughter turned it on. They ran like bats out of hell back to their house and haven't been heard since! Now I was a little sceptical at first, but I can't praise this product enough. You can not get anything else that will do this for you. You can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win. If you move, you might end up with more barking. Look. It's worth the money, believe me!!!!"
1576,kitchen_houseware,"I turned the device onto human sound because on sub-sonic, I didn't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning.  The device itself on human sound was triggered by many things, air condtioner, mower, air plane, thunder, etc. which was not good in that I doubt it would serve as an effective training device. The dogs seemed to trigger it at random times.  We have large lots here in this area of NJ and I placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem.  HOWEVER, my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole I placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs' outside times. She advised me that her book clubs (inside) and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly.  The capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation. I would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone"
1577,kitchen_houseware,"We have four dogs, and they're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking. One of our neighbors ""strongly suggested"" this product as a possible remedy. I did some investigation before purchasing, including talking to the manufacturer. Their sense was that it works for about 50% of dogs, which is in line with what I saw in other on-line reviews at the time (this was about a year and a half ago).Anyway, because they had a good return policy I went ahead and made the purchase, and it worked wonderfully. The barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it, and in fact we wished we had bought more (we have a very big yard). That led to our downfall: we were moving it around frequently, and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch. Oops.Needless to say, it didn't work after that. But, remarkably, the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months. Now the grass is green, the buds are blooming, and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive, so it's time to replace the unit. This time I'm buying two, and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer."
1578,kitchen_houseware,"This unit works great.. for a couple of months. I don't know if it's the rain or heat (neither is suppose to bother it), but after a couple of months, it simply quits sensing the barking. It gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger. In addition, the label starts to shrivel up.. a sign that it can't really handle the weather. I've sent 7 of these back.. now Smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them. Stay away from this dog"
1579,kitchen_houseware,"I was really dispirited to read so many unhappy reviews about this product.  Our groomer recommended and lent us this so we could try it out on our sheltie,(the barker) and our collie, (the follow-up barker) before investing in yet another ""bark deterrant"".  We have used it for 3 days both indoors and out using the audible feature to determine the correct sensitivity setting and finding the correct location before switching to ultrasound,while also using the reinforcing ""Quiet"". After observing how effective this product has been in the 3 days, we are ready to purchase.  I am sure that it probably won't work as effectively on 'garbage or gardening days' or in households that are very active, but it has prevented both dogs from getting into that ""wound up"" frame of mind on regular days giving me better peace of mind and the ability to make phone calls without that nuisance barking for no apparent reason.  Considering the $50 cost in comparison to some products in the $100 range which quit and had to be re-purchased immediately to not break training continuity - check with a trainer, boarder or groomer and test it out first.  We are very happy with this and are considering two for different locations in the house"
1580,kitchen_houseware,"I have done a lot of dog training but I have never trained in agility before and was looking to teach my dogs something new.  I have enjoyed using the tunnel inside during the heat of the summer to train my dogs and give them an activity to do.  Once they got the idea, they really enjoyed it.  I am eager to try the other equipment outside now that the temperature has cooled.  This product could have gotten a higher rating but the instruction manual was terrible.  The teaching methods in the training manual go against a dog's natural instinct.  I would recommend buying a book or researching the proper way to train for agility than to rely on the instruction manual"
1581,kitchen_houseware,"THIS IS THE GREATEST!  I had been pricing kits at about $1500 and more.  This was the answer to my dreams.  It is good quality, simple and is all you need for your dog to learn and have a great time"
1582,kitchen_houseware,Your Product's Name that really describes what the product really does!  It is amazing that the Hair magnet really is easy to use and more amazing is the manner in which it preformes gathering pet hair
1583,kitchen_houseware,"This is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go.  It's not a quick removal tool (think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming), but for things like wool dhurrie rugs, it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things.  It really does pull up tons of fur, even from deep in a rug"
1584,kitchen_houseware,"As a military spouse, we move, and have different types of floors that need cleaning.  I have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home, and also in our previous home abroad.  The Vaccum side does not work well at all, but I prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how I mop.  In comparison to sponge and rag mops, this leaves the floor pretty dry, and the suction is great.  As long as you empty the tank and keep it clean, and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank, it works wonderfully.  It's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers, that generally just push dirt around.  I believe it's worth the $$.  I've had mine for two years now"
1585,kitchen_houseware,The Bissell Flip-It saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop
1586,kitchen_houseware,"The flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did I know thatI would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop.  When using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where I stop, therefore I have to wipe up the floor with paper towels. When using the vacuum myliquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks!I have not recommended this product to anyone. A waste of $100.00"
1587,kitchen_houseware,"One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer. The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the ""flip it"" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the ""dirty water"" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer. On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day"
1588,kitchen_houseware,"I looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one.  I chose the Flip-It for the price which was much lower and for the size.  This unit if very light weight and easy to store and tote around.  I felt like the larger cleaner would be too much trouble to drag in and out. I have wood floors in the kitchen, nook, and foyer and I can clean the entire area with one tank and still have a little left over. It's not any faster than mopping but it's much easier.  My floors really clean and who wouldn't love that"
1589,kitchen_houseware,"Product arrived on day promised. The cleaner was ordered by my mother, who is no longer physically able to keep her bare floors as clean as desired by other methods. She tells me that she is very satisfied with the product. It cleans the floor to her high standards with a minimum of time and labor."
1590,kitchen_houseware,"I have really loved this set.  It looks great, cleans easily, and I love cooking with it.  You really need to use a lower heat setting when cooking, but once I got used to that I haven't had any problems"
1591,kitchen_houseware,"  After 40 years of marriage, I have finally found cookware that lives up to its description.  I enjoy cooking with these pots.  They cook evenly and are a breeze to clean.  The handles do not heat and feel balanced and safe while handling them.I even like the glass lids that allow me to see what's happening without lifting the lid.I just recommended them to my daughter-in-law"
1592,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price.  Wrong... This pots get scratches from anything that goes near them.  After a few months of gentle use, they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful.  Also, the handles get really hot.   "
1593,kitchen_houseware,I purchased this cookware based on very favorable reviews and I'm happy to say that these pots and pans are great!  Both my husband and I enjoy cooking and he's as happy with this cookware as I am.  He keeps telling me what a great buy I made!  I really like being able to cook at lower temps and I love the glass lids.  Anyone looking for excellent cookware at a reasonable price should buy this product
1594,kitchen_houseware,Bought this item for my daughter and she loves it.  Threw away her old stuff because of this.  Says in makes cooking enjoyable
1595,kitchen_houseware,"As most people do, I had accumulated several different types of cookware over the years.  It was a real treat to pass these onto my kids and just use this great Cuisinart Chef's Classic set.  I especially love the saute pan"
1596,kitchen_houseware,"I was very impressed with this cookware.  I was a little skecptical about the handles being stainless steel, because I thought they would be too hot to the touch while cooking.  However, I have had no problems picking up the pots or pans by the handle while they are still hot.  This is an exceptional buy for the money. "
1597,kitchen_houseware,"Just got these about 3 weeks ago.  They cook very well and I really like the see though lids.  The only thing I consider a con is that the food cooked in the pans can collect around the ""rivet"" that was used to secure the handle to the pan.  Kind of a pain to keep that area clean.  Overall very satisfied with the pans"
1598,kitchen_houseware,"Wonderful set... also got the 12QT stockpot with this free... so very slickdeal :)Great nonstick coating, but you really must hand wash... but that is ok!!"
1599,kitchen_houseware,"Good combination.  I keep the booklite at the computer so the adapter is nice to have, no worry about changing batteries"
1600,kitchen_houseware,"Accessory for the LED version of Zelco's excellent ""itty bitty booklight"".  Assure brightest light and eliminates need to change batteries every few days. "
1601,kitchen_houseware,"This will be the third Thumper I've bought.  Lost the first one on a trip, second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift.  It's simple to use, loud enough to wake you and doesn't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes.  The thumper pad is big enough to hit when you're groggy!  More products should be as easy to live with as this one! "
1602,kitchen_houseware,Having problems hanging your family photos?  This is the perfect product and inexpensive.  Sooooooo easy...
1603,kitchen_houseware,These are great.  I hung a heavy picture using one of these hooks and it is still hanging.  It was very easy to use
1604,kitchen_houseware,"They really do work as advertised.  They go right into drywall (be careful not to hit a stud however!) with no muss and no fuss.  I haven't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds, but for basic home picture hanging, etc. they really do work as advertised"
1605,kitchen_houseware,"Works as advertised.Can not be used if wall stud is directly behind use point.At roughly $1 per hook, a hammer and nail makes more sense"
1606,kitchen_houseware,"I picked up a dozen in Home Depot for less than $5. Same concept, just a lot cheaper!Two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen. The hole they make depends upon the weight of what they're holding. I'm sure it's pinhole sized if you're hanging something that weighs a few ounces (in which case, you don't need this - use a pushpin!)The holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized, but it IS a heavy shelf. The hole is still WAY smaller than the hole I'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf.It also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks (the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang.) This is a small detail, but if you need two of these things and you don't do it right, your object is gonna be crooked. But on the bright side, you won't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it!Recommended product (but look around for the knockoffs."
1607,kitchen_houseware,"These Hercules Hooks are absolutely incredible.  I wish I had them before my husband put many, many holes in our walls with anchors and screws.  If I want to relocate anything, he tries to patch up the hole, but it always shows.  These hooks make only a pin sized hole!  I hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it.  It is still there.  Incredible product and well worth the price"
1608,kitchen_houseware,This is a excellent product..  as described very easy to incert and position...  haven't checked the weight capability.. not disappointed
1609,kitchen_houseware,"  These hooks are incredible!!  I have used them throughout my home to hang heavy art work and mirrors, and the best part is that I can do it myself without waiting for my husband to get out his drill, hammer, leveler, etc.  I love them so much we have given them as house warming gifts, and everyone that has received them from us has been as amazed as we are by how effective and easy they are to use!  If you want a secure and quick way to hang anything on your walls without making a huge hole use these hooks! "
1610,kitchen_houseware,"I am very pleased with this fryer.  It heats up quickly and does a great job frying foods.  Unlike most consumer grade fryers, this one barely blinks when you drop a basket of frozen fries.  Other fryers 'choke,' lose so much heat and take so long to recover temperature that foods get soggy and clump together.  Not with this baby.  I used a coupon, got free shipping and there was a rebate for a stainless oil storage cannister.  This was a great deal"
1611,kitchen_houseware,Bought ours two years ago after considerable research. Busy working family with multiple schedules and a parade of hungry young adults have given it a workout. Not one problem yet.  Best one on the market as far as I am concerned. 
1612,kitchen_houseware,"this is a well thought out product for consumer use. easy to clean, easy to use. tried others and was very disappointed but i'm extremely pleased with this one. some advice stay away from the euro-pro"
1613,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased this deep fryer after doing considerable research on-line.  I wanted one with a good capacity and that would be reliable.  It has surpassed my expectations.  We have been using it for over a month.  The initial use was to fry chicken tenders for a large party.  15 lbs. of chicken tenders were fried in no time with very little oil useage.  Since that time we have fried okra, french fries, tater tots, onion petals, cheese sticks and even did fried ice cream.  All have turned out very well.  It holds a little shy of 1 gallon of oil.  This heats up in about 10 minutes.  There is an indicator light to let one know when it is up to temperature.  Once frozen food is put in the oil quickly comes back up to temperature.  This produces crisp foods with no oily taste and very little oil useage.  It has a breakaway magnetic cord to keep it from accidently being pulled off of the counter. It cleans up as easily as can be expected.  I just put the basket and the oil resevoir in the dishwasher.  The food can be lowered into the oil with the lid in place.  This keeps oil spatters to a bare minimum.  I have been very happy with my purchase.  So have the hoards of teenagers that gather at my house.  There has even been one instance when THEY brought the food and did their own frying.  Although frying is not the most healthy way to prepare food at least with this deep fryer it is easy, quick, tasty, nearly mess-free and about as grease free as possible.  While this one costs a bit more than others on the market I certainly feel as though I am getting my money's worth"
1614,kitchen_houseware,"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.I would recommend this with no caveats"
1615,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased this for my wife.  A hundred bucks for a knife insane!  Until you use it.  I think this is worth the money.  My wife says is the best thing since sliced bread.  And... you can slice bread with it.   Seriously, great knife.  It will last a long time.  Don't keep buy cheapo knives year after year.  Just get one of these.  Very sharp edge, nice weight, and comfortable."
1616,kitchen_houseware,"After working with a combination of German knives for more than ten years, I decided to buy a Global knife and give it a shot.  It feels great in my hand and is easy to handle and work with.  The blade is incredibly sharp and has held its edge very well.All in all, I liked this knife so much that I decided I wanted more of them and bought the 6-piece set.  I can't give it a much better endorsement than that"
1617,kitchen_houseware,"I bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable.  As a vegetarian, I use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless.  Money very well spent as I know it'll last a lifetime"
1618,kitchen_houseware,I originally bought this knife because one of the chefs at the restaurant I work at had one. I picked it up one day and the lightness and balance blew my mind. A couple weeks later I bought my own as well as a ceramic water sharpener. I have no idea what that other guy must be doing to his knife but my blade sharpens very easily and stays sharp for months as long as you don't abuse it. By far my favorite knife that I have used.One warning though: if you are going to do a large amount of chopping (like say you're a prep cook or you make Thanksgiving-like dinners twice a month) then the angled shape of the back of the blade may rub the side of your knife-hand index finger the wrong way. I cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday and have only been irritated by the shape a few times under heavy chopping regimes but it is something to consider.Overall I couldn't love this knife more. It's the most important kitchen tool I have ever owned
1619,kitchen_houseware,bought a global knife a few years ago  then bought the water/ ceramic sharpening device. cannot keep this knife sharp. it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels. I use the cheap sabatiers ($9 for the set and the block)anway it's no worse than any of my other dull knives just cost mor
1620,kitchen_houseware,"I baught my 8"" global chef's knife about 5 years ago.  It has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market.  The molybdenum/vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its Henkles/Wustolf counterparts.  My only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style, nor my large hands.  I don't mind the steel handles, although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip.  My main problem is with the tapered bolster, which is almost a lack of bolster altogether.  Coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife, extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand.I highly recommend globals, but I might suggest the 8 1/4"" heavyweight model, which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the Bolster.  For more info on knife handling and care you might check out the CIA's book titled ""The Professional Chef's Knife Kit"".And one last comment.  Although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe, please, PLEASE, don't put your knives in the dishwasher. "
1621,kitchen_houseware,"I desperately needed a new knife because my old Chicago Cutlery wooden handle knife became a gross and nasty E. coli distributing piece of junk. which was very sad because I loved that knife! I had it for 20+ years. I ended up buying this knife because I really liked the look of the handle. It looked like it would grip well. and it does. To me it seemed a bit expensive, but the Stainless Chicago Cutlery knives handles were very smooth so there were few choices for me. The most important point is what ever brand you choose, go with non-wooden handles. don't make the mistake that I made by holding on to those old wooden handle knives. Bacteria will eventually get in them and then they will make you sick"
1622,kitchen_houseware,"We have Sabatier and Wusthof sets but this is the first knife that every one of the family goes for first.Perfect balance, easy to sharpen, cuts meat, juliennes perfectly; even slices tomatoes.Pair this with the Global paring knife and really that's all you need. (Although my wife now wants her own for Christmas - clearly she's an incurable romantic)"
1623,kitchen_houseware,"The design for using the DC adapter with this little light is extremely poor.  It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter.  But, it must not have been very big.  I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case.  These were brand new batteries.  There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them.  This is bad.  Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.Then, after I cleaned it all up, it worked for about a week w/o the batteries installed.  Then the LEDs started flickering.  The next day, it was dead.  To see if it had to do with the battery leak, I took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head.  But something on the little circuit board must have blown.  The other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book.  I found this a problem with soft cover books, at least.  Putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better.I had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions.  I've gone through many Zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out.  This one is beyond my ability and I'm done giving Zelco my money.  They are a nice idea, but have no durability.  If they were cheaper, it might not be such a big deal, but for their price I would like to see them be far more durable"
1624,kitchen_houseware,"Purchased the item, arrived defective, replacement was also defective"
1625,kitchen_houseware,"I have looked over this product (it is a birthday present for someone else, so I haven't actually used it) and find that it meets all my expectatons for size, light weight, design"
1626,kitchen_houseware,Very well made reading light. Nice carrying case. Decent battery consumption. Fits most of the books really well.Happy reading
1627,kitchen_houseware,NOT a good light.  The light is already fading and I don't use it very often.  Very disappointed
1628,kitchen_houseware,"I have tried a number of different battery-powered booklights and they all go through batteries in about 5 minutes.  This light can be purchased with an AC adapter, eliminating the need to constantly replace batteries.  It is bright enough to clearly illuminate the pages of your book, stays where it's clipped and reasonably adjustable.  I love it"
1629,kitchen_houseware,The light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night.  It would have been better with three for four LEDs
1630,kitchen_houseware,I love this light!  I spend hours reading in bed each week and this light is just perfect since it shines a perfect amount of light over the book w/o disturbing my husband.  It's also a real treat never having to worry about replacing lightbulbs (like most other reading lights).  Couple it with the electric adapter and you have a reading light with no maintenance
1631,kitchen_houseware,"I baked six loaves in this machine.  I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right.  My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund"
1632,kitchen_houseware,I bought this breadmaker because I wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf.  It makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use.  Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and I recommend that you use the recipes created for the machine unless you are a baking pro.Nothing smells better than a homemade loaf of bread baking in the kitchen!I have not bought a loaf of bread since I've owned this fine bread making machine
1633,kitchen_houseware,"I've been using my Zojirushi for over two years now and make at least a couple loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread a week along with fancier breads using the dough function.  I love the fact that there are two paddles to knead the bread, this works so much better than my machine of 10 years ago with just one paddle which often left gobs of unkneaded incredients.  I also really like the horizontal full loaf pan.  You can make normal sandwich loaves with this design.The one thing that could be improved would be to add more user control to allow a baker to set all the resting, rising and baking times individually.  Sometimes I want the dough to rise longer than the preset times but there's no way of overriding it.  Oh well, guess nothing is perfect.I highly recommend this product"
1634,kitchen_houseware,"I have had 4 different bread machines, all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style.  I didn't mind the bread they turned out, but I didn't like the loaf shape.  My prayers have been answered!  I can't quit making bread now!  The loaves come out perfect, and if they don't I have come to relize that with bread it is typically the COOK's error, not the machine's.  You need to really read the directions, which I find most people don't.  If you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine, you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it.  I've made all kinds of sweet, sourdough, french, italian, herb and cheese, fruit, and beer breads in the machine.....you name it, and they all come out just fine.  If not, I tweak the recipe, I don't blame the machine.All in all, an excellent product. This is my favorite bread machine so far.  The only down side is the sourdough setting.  Don't be fooled... the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar.  For true sourdough, you have to wait the 7-10 days.  But if you can't wait....  Oh, and the ""big viewing window"".  Unless someone installs a light inside the machine, you can't really see what's going on anyway.  After my first 50 loaves I will let you know how it's holding up"
1635,kitchen_houseware,"I own the zojirushi bread machine for about a year. I bake 1-2 per week. The machine makes excellent bread  dough. I haven't bought a loaf of bread since I bought this machine. When I want a more crusty bread, make pizza, or make a foccacia I use the dough cycle with amazing results. Highly reccomend this product. P.S. It takes a little practice, if you never used a bread machine before.Read instuctions carefully  measure ingredients. If your bread is slopsided watch for drafts. Most of my breads come out looking picture perfect  the taste you can't compare it with store bought bread. Plus, no preservatives or additives of any kind"
1636,kitchen_houseware,"I bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and I use it every day. The white and rye bread recipes turn out perfectly every time.  I've also made an apple cake and two meatloafs.  I tried one wheat bread loaf ... it was very tasty, but not quite the consistency that I like ... so I need to play around with that one alittle bit.   I've never been a cook and definitely have never baked a loaf of bread before ... but now that my kids are grown up, I now have some time to work in the kitchen.  I highly recommend this machine"
1637,kitchen_houseware,"Within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off. This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect.This is my third (and final) bread machine. The first two were Breadman Ultimates. I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average, pretty much every morning.The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. This was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond).I bought an new Breadman Ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. This time I took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down, no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed, making the machine useless. Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman.At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one.Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect.I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate:1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much.2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense.3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs.4) The programmability options are very limited:- You can't control the knockdown time between risings.- You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings.- You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle.- When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones. - And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a ""safety feature"" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion.For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations.At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology. All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination.A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution.I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology. It's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution"
1638,kitchen_houseware,"We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients.  We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work.  Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate"
1639,kitchen_houseware,"I had several bread machines before my Zojirushi, and they baked ok but with my Zojirushi is just amazing, I bake the most delicious and gorgeous breads, cakes and jams.Throw away all your bread machines and get the BEST.get one Zojirushi.Also try other products from Zojirushi, I have the rice machine and the eletric skillet and the are great"
1640,kitchen_houseware,i have been using six second abs for a month. i can see my stomach getting flatter. so i wouldnt believe the commericals that say it took them a week to get a six pack but if you want a flatter stomach then this will help overtime
1641,kitchen_houseware,Contrary to the opinion expressed in the previous review I found the resistance levels more than adequate. It might be that it was being used incorrectly by using the back and arms rather than pulling from the abs. I developed very good ab definition after around 2 months working out at 120 crunches on my back 3 times/week. Only problem was the machine broke when it wasn't even on the highest setting - but I intend buying another
1642,kitchen_houseware,"It's a great concept although resistance is almost useless. I'm in my mid-thirties and, although reasonably fit, have never been able to pull off hundreds of crunches mainly because of back problems when doing them. Here was a solution which claimed to get around this. When I first got the unit, I gave it a go and found the resistance almost unnoticeable. I opened the front, replaced the yellow bands with the ""heavy duty"" orange ones and tried again - again, almost nothing. At 6 seconds a rep, 10 minutes gets you 100 reps. Don't know about you but although I could do 100 crunches in the conventional sense, I would certainly know about it the next day. I tried 100 reps on this contraption two days in a row without feeling a thing. This makes the commercials you see showing the six pack wielding workout freaks claiming they ""feel the burn"" very hard to believe. With that said, this isn't necessarily the fault of ""As Seen on TV"" that they sell this product - what's worthless to me may still be of value to someone else although I can't imagine who. They did offer my money back in full despite the usual 10% restocking fee but given that a third of the sale price was a non-refundable shipping cost, it hardly makes it worth the effort. Am going to find another use for it - perhaps a coat hanger?Positive voters must be getting kick-backs from somewhere. Perhaps they got their money back if they agreed to promote it.Don't believe me - buy one and find out for yourself."
1643,kitchen_houseware,"We use these more than any other dishware items in our pantry. They go from the fridge to the microwave to the oven. Plus, they are indestructable, whether dropped, banged in the dishwasher, or otherwise abused. They are pretty small however; U can fit a can of corn or heat up a  chicken breast or two in the microwave, but not much more fits into it. We have 8 for a family of 4, and we could use a couple more if we had the space. So buy extras"
1644,kitchen_houseware,"I only bought 2 and now wish I'd purchased 8. They are heavy and appear very durable. The lid is fairly thick and has a tight seal, actually much better than expected. Wait for them to reappear on the Friday sale and save a couple of bucks. I assure you you won't be disappointed"
1645,kitchen_houseware,"It is the perfect size for a bowl to eat out of, it has a lid so it is good for leftovers or taking to work, and having a handle is great.  There are no worries about taking a hot dish out of the microwave: you just grab the handle and eat.  Probably, ideal for teens or college kids.  Also, they also hold up well.  We have a couple that are about 10 years old, and recently bought some more on Amazon"
1646,kitchen_houseware,"I love the grab-its!  They are wonderful.  I was so disappointed when the outlet store I used to buy them from told me that they no longer make these.  So, I am thrilled that I was still able to find these online and with the lids!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
1647,kitchen_houseware,"i've got one of these floating around my house (without the lid) with the other ""common"" (shared) dishes.. and i have to say, everyone loves this one. i think it's great b/c of the handle, more than anything else. college students like handles on their dishes"
1648,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this to use for ""brown bagging"" but have used it for so much more. THis little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks, all without having to change the contents to a ""dressier"" dish. French White is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money"
1649,kitchen_houseware,"I love these dishes, I bought these because I need more dishes to go with a set that is patterned but the basic color is white, they mix with the set beautifully!   I like the feel of the classic Wedgewood bone china so I'm glad they priced this set so I can afford to use them for everyday dishes. The packing left alot to be desired very flimsy boxes, but surprising everything made to me in one piece, so I'm very happy with my purchase"
1650,kitchen_houseware,"I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware.  Best set I have every owned or used.  Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots  pans.The fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top.  I paid $24.99 for this when I bought a few other pieces.  Got free shipping  $25.00 off the order"
1651,kitchen_houseware,It works great and I like being able to use metal spoons.  It apears to be of great quality
1652,kitchen_houseware,"Very pleased with the quality of this pan, good weight and cooks food evenly, clean up is easy too. Good product"
1653,kitchen_houseware,This was my first calaphalon purchase and I am so impressed that I plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future. This pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1/2 qt pans.The unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food. Hand washing the pan is easy. I love this pan !!
1654,kitchen_houseware,LOVED this pan; I got several others too.  Price was much below average
1655,kitchen_houseware,"I am so over nonstick--even Calphalons.  I have been gradually replacing all my nonstick with uncoated cookware.  This Saucepan really rocks.  I use it all the time.  I don't have to worry about scratching it, and I really haven't had much trouble with clean up."
1656,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased this pot in January, and have used it several times a week since.  I love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications, it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top (grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review).  The pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well, and I looked forward to years of use until I boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles.  The noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking, scrubbing, cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again.  Because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot, I will definatly be purchasing another pot.Overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price, so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch I would totally reccomend it just don't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes.   "
1657,kitchen_houseware,"I like the size and shape of this saucepan. It is big enough for something like spaghetti sauce or even mashed potatoes, but not so big is overwhelms smaller jobs.Cleans up nice and the lid is good"
1658,kitchen_houseware,"Really have enjoyed using this Saucepan.  Cooks evenly, does not stick, cleans up good.  Thinking of purchasing more of this product"
1659,kitchen_houseware,The money tree arrived today on time. It was a gift to me :) I opened the box and couldn't believe how perfect this tree was. I'm going to have to purchase some more of these soon. Especially for the holidays. The roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree. Thanks
1660,kitchen_houseware,"I have ten dogs and eleven cats plus I volunteer at a local rescue group, and I always keep a couple of bottles in my medicine chest.  Two of my dogs use it all the time:  a golden retriever with allergies and a cocker spaniel with chronic ear infections due to severe neglect in his previous life.   Zymox with hydrocortisone has an enzyme that promotes natural healing plus the hydrocortisone takes the itch away so they don't scratch themselves raw thus prolonging/enlarging the infection.  I also use it on the ocassional yeast or bacterial infection (you don't even have to guess what kind because it works for both), twice a day for a couple of weeks takes care of it without having to pay a vet's examination fee"
1661,kitchen_houseware,"My dog had ear problems for years and finally came across this product.  Cleared it up in one week, with only a couple of applications.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog with chronic ear problems"
1662,kitchen_houseware,My chihuahua has had chronic ear problems since he was a little puppy.  I'm not a fan of the antibiotic ointments that vets prescribe because they contain medication he doesn't need for his yeast problems.  I've tried all sorts of natural ear cleansers to no avail.  I found this product highly recommended by an online vet site so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Within 2 days his ears looked perfect...no scratching or shaking either.  It's been 3 weeks since I last put in the drops and I haven't had to worry about them since.  I honestly can't believe how well this solution works.  I'm so happy my little guy isn't feeling miserable with his ears anymore. :
1663,kitchen_houseware,"My golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old.  Over the years we have tried allergy shots, dietary changes, and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune.  We tried Zymox and it is absolutely fantastic.  Her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment.  The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear.  This stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges, I'm happy to keep it on hand"
1664,kitchen_houseware,"My beagles have chronic ear infections and I was spending hundreds of dollars per year to keep them in check - doctor visits in order to get the prescribed (and expensive) mal-otic.  Zymox Otic has solved the problem, keeping their ears nice and clear and clearing up the infections they had when I started it.  Be sure to use it daily at first if they have an infection. "
1665,kitchen_houseware,"irecently purchased a bottle of zymox with hydrocortisone for my lab who has had several really bad ear infections i was spending a fortune at the vets office.i searched the web until i read about this product.i decided to give it a try.im sooooo glad i did.this works !her ears are clear ,she is happy again.i will keep buying this product.thank you zymox"
1666,kitchen_houseware,"This product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments I had received there.  Zymox takes about a week to work, with one or two treatments a day.  It has had the same effect for my sister's dog who had had recurrent ear infections. I have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success"
1667,kitchen_houseware,"My 10 yr old Cocker Spaniel has had cronic ear infections for 4 yrs.  She has developed a resistance towards most antibiotics and steroids and all antibiotics make her stomach sour. Some antibiotics even make her ears worse! Nothing works completely, but Zymox seems to give her a reasonable comfort zone. Without Zymox, expensive total ear canal ablation surgery would be her only option. After expensive TPLO surgery and 4 years of ear infections, my finances have been exhausted. Zymox has given me better results than the vet, saves $150 a month vs the vet, and is well worth the daily ear cleaning and drops"
1668,kitchen_houseware,"I read about Zymox on a vet's website regarding chronic ear infections. My black Lab is a rescue from the street and she had chronic ear infections when I found her. The usual story of rounds of antibiotics, including expensive Baytril, without resolution of her problem. It's been almost a month now and her ears are improving. I find that I cannot skip a day or the gooey black gunk recurs, but if done daily she has little goo. I plan on continuing every day and I hope we can clear her ears up before swimming season returns. Zymox has certainly been an improvement over antibiotics"
1669,kitchen_houseware,"This is the extra chime that you can purchase if you already have the receiver. I am purchasing another one because it's working so well. I am a professional dog trainer, and all I can say is that the product is great, but that owners who do not know how to teach something to their dogs  probably should call a dog trainer for help with this if you are unsure how to proceed.As a professional dog trainer, I still live with my family members who are decidedly not dog trainers. Our toy poodle was essentially house-trained when I was home, but because my teenagers and husband were oblivious to her subtle signals that she needed to go out, she ended up peeing in front of the door, because nobody was letting her out. So, I got the Lentek Door Chime, and taught my dog to use it, and now no more accidents because she is signaling in a way that everybody can hear. We also put the pad outside so she can signal to come back in. Everybody is happy. Now I'm getting another pad for upstairs, because we still have oblivious teens and hubby....So, great product, but be sure that you have *both* parts of the product, and give a good trainer a call to help you get started."
1670,kitchen_houseware,"It takes a little patience to get the dog to use it, at first she thought is was a treat machine, but eventually she realized it meant go outside. Works very well."
1671,kitchen_houseware,"Easy to use.  Our dog learned how to use it reliably in a couple of days.  No directions came with it, we called our trainer and asked how to do it. "
1672,kitchen_houseware,I thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out. I was so excited to get it... and the chime didn't work. Oh Well
1673,kitchen_houseware,I hung 2 big jingle bells on a sturdy ribbon by the door  it accomplishes the same thing with no batteries to worry about! Consistantly ring the bell before opening the door and he'll learn in 2 or 3 days
1674,kitchen_houseware,We love our pet chime. It took a little time to train our dog on it but now it's the only thing he uses to tell us he wants to go out. It's also a great conversation piece when company is over. We've had ours for over 1 year and changed the batteries in the receiver once and haven't had any problems. We're getting an extra paw
1675,kitchen_houseware,"In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw  two additional paws.  I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks.  In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek.  They're great, IF THEY WORK"
1676,kitchen_houseware,"It's hard to find anything wrong with such a damn good juicer that I only paid $25 for.  What can beat that?  Money very well spent.  It does spray a little depending on what you're putting in, but again what juicer doesn't?  I can live with this for $25!  Wear an apron duh.It does say in the manual that it doesn't do wheatgrass, I missed that bit, but no biggie!  I can cope for only $25..  Carrots, beets, celery, cabbage, ginger, cucumber, peppers, apples, pears etc, all hard veg and fruit are just perfect, it does these really well.  I adore Oranges done in this juicer, with all the pith on they come out so creamy!  Not acidic like regular OJ.  I'm still hooked, got my juicer a few weeks back and I'm still using it daily.  it's awesome"
1677,kitchen_houseware,"   I'd been looking for a good juicer for a number of months, but had shied away because they're expensive.  I saw this deal, read and analyzed the reviews, and rolled the dice.  It arrived yesterday, and after easily disassembling it to wash the parts and get to know it initially, I ran a half dozen carrots through it.  OMG!!  Fast and delicious carrot juice in my own kitchen!  Clean-up was easy (well, I was an old pro by now) and quick--under five minutes.     To address some of the negatives you may read, first, size:  of course it's big.  They're all big and bulky.  It's their nature.  Second, residue:  my carrot pulp was DRY.  I suppose if I'd put it on the floor and stood on it I might have gotten maybe another teaspoon of carrot juice out of it.  Third, it's factory reconditioned:  for me, that's a plus.  Consider this:  the manufacturer rolls out tens of thousands of these off the line, each one eye-balled and polished by QC before bagging and boxing, assuming that they are all good to go.  But, a factory re-con is gone over from top to bottem, inside and out before it's released.  No assumptions--the last thing the manufacturer wants is to see that thing back again, so you know they'll make sure they don't.  And if it'd been returned for a little cosmetic blem, I can certainly live with that considering the discount I'm getting.   I'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away, but Waring is an old and trusted brand, and the juicer is not cheaply made.  I'll be back in a year (hopefully not sooner) to give some time perspective to this review.  As soon as I finish writing this, I'm ordering two more as Christmas gifts.  "
1678,kitchen_houseware,"Though I have not tried the juicer yet, but i could not pass off the price"
1679,kitchen_houseware,"I am very happy with it: inexpensive, easy to clean and nice-looking. Highly recommend"
1680,kitchen_houseware,"I've wanted a juicer for a long time, but could never really justify the expense, knowing that I'd very likely quickly tire of the maintenance involved. When I saw this juicer for under $25, it seemed like the perfect opportunity. When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed with the unit's solid construction. You can see right away that this isn't a plastic piece of junk that's going to break righ away.With the unit's first use, I juiced: cabbage, kale, spinach, carrots, onions and peppers. The unit - while not as powerful as more expensive models, I'm sure - juiced up everything with no hesitation. I would describe the pulp to be damp, but not what I'd call really wet.I dreaded the juicer clean-up process that I'd heard so much about. Disassembly of the unit is a breeze. There are basically three main parts to remove and it takes all of thirty-seconds. No problem.If there's one thing I could change, it would be a better designed pulp-catcher that would allow a bag to be used. This is only a minor gripe and has in no way made me regret the purchase.If you are a casual juicer, looking to get your feet wet without spending a ton of money, this would be a perfect choice. I'm still amazed that I got this for under $25 and I'd recommend it without hesitation"
1681,kitchen_houseware,"I would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone! It is stylish, sleek,easy to clean, and has plenty of power to handle anything. I feel sorry for michigan, mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink! Awesome! Awesome The first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol' prune who wouldn't be happy with anything! Get it now!"
1682,kitchen_houseware,"I'm absolutely thilled with this Waring! It's definitely changed my opinion of juicers.  I purchased the reconditioned model.  It arrived factory (re?)-packaged and looked brand new.  Not a single mark on it, not even a fingerprint!  It's far easier to clean, obviously by superior design: the parts clean up like new in the dishwasher.  The components fit perfectly, despite probably a couple hundred uses. It's exponentially faster, and the remainders are noticeably dryer. (As another reviewer mentioned, this refuse obviously indicates a very efficient juicer!) Looks, sounds and functions like a very upscale appliance. No spraying, no movement, no juicer ""drama""! :-) Absolutely the best one I've owned and after lots of uses, it's still going as strong as it did when it arrived.  "
1683,kitchen_houseware,"I received my Reconditioned Waring Juice Extractor today.  So far, so good.   I've wanted to have a juicer for a long time, but was discouraged becasue of the prices.   This unit sells refubed for $25-$30 here on ebay.   For that price, I had to order.   Assembly takes about 30 seconds.  I sliced up an apple and tossed in some celery and a pear.  The motor sounds very powerful and went through everything I tossed in there quite quickly.   Wow.   Very good.  I can see this is going to cost a lot in fresh fruits and veggies.   Now, I wouldn't say mine is completely splash free, but only a few tiny drops at most escaped.  The fiber/pulp that was left behind was moist, but not dripping wet.  I'd give it an 87% for extraction.    Clean up was easy.  There are basically 6 parts to this thing.   The metal cup, the spinning bit, the catching part, the lid, the plundger, and the motor/main unit.  They all come apart for easy cleaning.  The spinning bit's screen gets gunk clogging the holes, but that cleans easily with a sponge and the included brush.   The catch, pludger, and lid are plastic and can go in the upper part of the dish washer.  Or you can do it by hand in about a minute.   Great deal thus far"
1684,kitchen_houseware,This juicer is fantastic. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was and was actually rather apprehensive when it arrived. I plugged it in and juiced half of my fridge. It was so good that I just juiced the other half.
1685,kitchen_houseware,This food coloring was the best I have ever used.  It is very concentrated. I obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time.  I did not notice a flavor at all so I look forward to trying the black.  The bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish
1686,kitchen_houseware,"I bought these to decorate some dia de los muertos skulls with icing.  The Ateco food coloring gave nice bright, vibrant colors and mixed with the icing very well. I was totally satisfied with the purchase"
1687,kitchen_houseware,"These are easy to use, they do not make a mess, and offer vibrant colors.   They do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can.  I would  highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate"
1688,kitchen_houseware,I purchased 2 of these cages and my first comment is that the picture of the cage is just what you are getting. It is hard to find a large cage for parakeets with the correct bar spacing so no one slips out. This cage was the answer for all of our needs. Not only is the bar spacing great for our paratkeets but there is lots of room. The stand that the cage sits on is very sturdy and does not wobble like a lot of cages that come with seperate stands. Assembly is also easy. The only time I had to pull out a tool was to put the stand together and that was very easy to do. If you are using this cage for parakeets you should use twisty ties to secure the doors even more. Parakeets love to lift the doors up and down and it is a matter of time before they realize they can also get out. The cage is also very nice for our parakeets because it has different levels that the birds love to explore. Great cag
1689,kitchen_houseware,"Junk, junk, junk. Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service.Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever. This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website. We purchased Cuisinart, works great"
1690,kitchen_houseware,"The best Salsa, The best Pesto, and Salad dressings made with this food processorwe all should have one"
1691,kitchen_houseware,"This is a terrific machine.  Amazon's price beat everyone, especially with their 20% promotional discount, no sales tax and no shipping charges.  The oversized feed tube makes pre-processor preparation much simpler as I don't have to try to ""fit"" my ingredients into a narrow tube.  Clean-up is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the fully-sealed motor/base which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any misses/messes.  It's quiet and efficient.  I only wish that there were more outlets (hear me Amazon?) that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level.  Overall, I am highly satisfied and happy I spent a little more and got the best"
1692,kitchen_houseware,This is our first food processor. Did a lot of looking before making this purchase. It's easy to use and clean.  Made Salsa with our garden fresh tomatoes the day it arrived.  Makes slicing a breeze.  Great price from Amazon!  No complaints of any kind
1693,kitchen_houseware,"This is a significant improvement over the 750 model. The 750 model was not very well designed. The first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. We returned this. We got the 760 to replace that. The 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. For the same price as the 750, the 760 comes with one extra bowl,  juicer and egg whisk. Compared with others like the Cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed."
1694,kitchen_houseware,"This is the best kitchen appliance we own.  My wife has saved more time with this appliance.  Very strong motor, nice look.  Our garden is all choppped up"
1695,kitchen_houseware,"very happy with the proformance of the processor.made the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done great.the pizza still needs to be worked on lol.all-in-all,fantastic product"
1696,kitchen_houseware,I loved this item until it became fused to the base.  I called CS and they sent me a prepaid UPS label to ship it back and issued a full refund and send me a letter with a $50 off coupon to keep using Kitchenaid.  Very impressive
1697,kitchen_houseware,Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday.  Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun.  My father tried to contact them and nobody responded.  I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund.I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist
1698,kitchen_houseware,Hey guys get these flowers and score some points.........!!! they looked good and smelled great. my wife was impressed .....oh by the way send them to her work......
1699,kitchen_houseware,When the person got the flowers she really liked them. She talked and talked about them. She also was suprised in a good way how long the flowers lasted (roses). I ordered flowers from them for Mother's Day because of my experince. Great job
1700,kitchen_houseware,"Showed up on time, with a cold pack, wraped in a box and a phone number to contact and the person who inspected it.  Very nicely done"
1701,kitchen_houseware,I surprised a friend with these flowers. They arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo.Even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses. To bad that they are not shipping in Romania.Update: After 5 days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice. I am so glad that I could make someone happy with these very nice roses
1702,kitchen_houseware,my wife recived the roses the next day of the order in a box. the roses were dead and black. she thought i was mad at her. do not buy. i repeat... do not buy
1703,kitchen_houseware,I checked the ProFlowers site and it said I still had 3 days to order the flowers to ensure they got there before Christmas.  It's now the day after Christmas and they still haven't gotten them
1704,kitchen_houseware,"The flowers not only arrived in good time, they were also so lovely.  My friend, who loves roses, was very impressed.  Definitely a great purchase"
1705,kitchen_houseware,I was so glad to find a source of replacement bulbs for my Itty Bitty Book Light.....and at such a reasonable price.  Fast shipping too
1706,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this device one week ago and I like it a lot. It counts steps pretty accurately, I measured it three time and I got the following results: 401/400, 101/100 and 897/900. The first number is what it showed, the second what I walked. Basically accuracy at 1% or better, which is exceptional for this price. I use the least sensitive setting.The backlight is very nice and by tilting the device a bit more one can see the display clearly at night. The clamshell design is also nice and practical, avoiding pressing buttons accidentaly (and resetting for example a day's steps).Now, do not buy this device for the FM radio. The reception is pretty poor and the quality of sound when you get a signal is what you would expect from a device costing as much as this. Plus I guess it will deplete the batteries much faster than just the pedometer function. I do not know if the other device of the same company with the calorie meter uses the same mechanism, but probably it would be more practical and for the same price provide something more.In conclusion, this device has a good price for what it gives, although there are accurate pedometers with less money that someone can buy, but definately do not seem as sturdy. Personally I like this device a lot and I highly recommend it (pending of course to see how long it will last as well as how long it takes to change batteries)"
1707,kitchen_houseware,"If you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment, this isn't for you. The radio is hard to use since it doesn't have any indication of what frequency you are on, and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static. The pedometer function is marginal at best. But its what you would expect for $15."
1708,kitchen_houseware,"I bought one of these for my girlfriend... THEN read the reviews! In my opinion it appears to work fairly well. The sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage. To the far left seems to work best for 'normal' walking. As I said, in terms of accuracy, I think it's pretty good. The radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5' stars. The sound is ""tinny""; it's NOT stereo; there's NO frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size! Though overall, when comparing price to features... this little fella will probably suit your needs. If you already have a Walkman (or don't care about audio) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet"
1709,kitchen_houseware,"Excellent pedometer for the money.  Worthwhile investment.  I only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity, and now it works great.  Radio works great also.. Definately reccommend"
1710,kitchen_houseware,"This pedometer is great. It's very small and very light. I forget it's even there. It keeps me motivated to walk more and the radio is wonderful for walks around the neighborhood. I have dropped it a couple of times, but it has not damaged the Pedometer at all. It's a great product and I definitely recommend it"
1711,kitchen_houseware,"I was amazed at how much I am enjoying my Flavia Fusion. I saw it at a boat show and tried some. My husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I really love it. I love the decaf house blend. It is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf. Decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it.The Flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee. I also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well. I like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks.It surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research BEFORE buying it. It is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee. The Flavia is a luxury item, not for a poor working stiff. Anyway, the Flavia is fast and simple and convenient. In fact, I'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now. Enjoy it"
1712,kitchen_houseware,"I absolutely love this machine!  The selection of coffees and teas is wonderful.  I am a tea drinker, primarily Engish Breakfast and Chai latte, and I am quite picky about the quality.  With some of the pod brewers I have tried, the tea has been quite weak.  However with the Flavia, the Engish Breakfast tea is very good.  The Chai is excellent as well.  The Chai latte is very smooth and doesn't have the peppery taste that some can have.  Pros: 1. Great tasting coffees and teas      2. Great selection      3. Virtually no clean up      4. You can brew a cup of tea after making coffee and the tea doesn't           taste like coffee (very important)Cons: 1. You better make sure the bottom of the brewer is flush with the                top of the cup or it will blow whatever you are brewing all over you and your kitchen.  This will only happen once, trust me, because you will not want this to happen again.      2. You can only purchase coffees and teas through their website.         Hopefully as this machine becomes more popular there will be more                    options for purchasing"
1713,kitchen_houseware,What a quick easy way to make a great cup of coffee. I like to mix the packs up and make my own brew. I have freinds that love the machine and went and bought them one. This is the best coffee machine we have ever owned.What I like is I can mix the diffrent packs and make my own brew that you cant get in a coffee shop or at the store. HINT. get the Vanilla Syrup pack and add it in the mix
1714,kitchen_houseware,"We have bought several coffee makers over the past few years seeking the elusive cup of coffee house quality coffee. At long last, it has arrived in the form of the Flavia Fusion! This is the easiest, quickest, most delicious cup of home brewed coffee or tea you will ever make. The unit does have a large footprint, but it definitely fits on the counter without taking up too much room if you have an average sized kitchen or larger. Set up is simple - remove from box, insert the filter, fill it with water and plug it in. Thats it. Once you ""prime"" the system (pressing two buttons on the top while simultaneously flipping the power switch)you're ready to go. Insert the beverage packet, adjust the height to accommodate your drinking vessel, push the button and voila! Since the water is preheated you get a hot, delicious beverage of choice in 30 seconds. If you get the ""medley"" pack (value $29.99)you also get a free travel mug. Contrary so what some reviewers have said, it DOES fit in the unit when you remove the drip tray. The medley pack is a nice extra as it gives you the opportunity to taste test every flavor being investing in a large purchase and finding out you don't like it. The ""creamy topping"" is a must have for any special ""indulgence"" drinks you want, a necessity for the exotic chai if you want it to taste just like Starbucks, which it does. This is a fantastic time saver in the morning, and when you have guests its terrific to be able to make a different flavor for each person. As for clean up, there are two words..""what cleanup?"". You take the package out of the machine and throw it in the garbage, simple as that. No more filters to buy, no more pots to descale, no more throwing out half of the pot that you didn't drink. Just amazing."
1715,kitchen_houseware,"This machine is wonderful! I first tried Flavia coffee a couple of years ago while waiting for my car to be serviced at the Mercedes dealership. Best coffee I'd had in a long time. It's so nice to walk into the kitchen, insert a packet and push a button for a cup of hot......whatever I feel like! This machine deserves a five rating in the ease of use and the flavor of the packets, whether they are teas, coffee or chocolate. I would recommend this to anyone"
1716,kitchen_houseware,"I love this machine. Each package is its own brewing system. That means that there is nothing to clean, nothing to clog, and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other. I love strong coffee and I found even the House Brand to be full flavored. Most surprising is how good the teas taste. You actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea. The herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor. The only disappointment was the hot chocolate: It was basically just as good as Swiss Miss. The frothing packages do work, but I get just as good if not better from skim milk and a $2 gizmo from IKEA. They are nice to keep on hand. The Milky Way froth does give a nice caramel flavor. The big down side is you can only get refills from Flavia. They have recently started giving free shipping on orders over $100, so stock up and get the free shipping. My big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir: I have accidentially run out of water more than once. The machine does 'spit' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup"
1717,kitchen_houseware,"I have the black Fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room), and my wife and I already love this machine.  We have tried all sorts of mixes, and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do.  This is one of the first times I've been so impressed with a product that I wanted to write a review for it.Physical properties: It handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray, which is largely unneeded anyway), and all our ""standard"" mugs.  The drink head moves up and down, so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with ""frothy"" drinks than coffee and tea).  When it brews a filterpack, it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and, thus, keep it from dripping as you remove it).  The water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long), but if you have a ready source of water nearby, it shouldn't be a problem.  The tank fits better and slides on easier than the Senseo (which we also have).Flavor-wise: It's made by M/Mars, so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called Indulgence fare) is excellent.  Coffee blends are quite good, especially the darker roasts like ""French Roast"" and ""Sumatra"".  Lattes made with Espresso Roast taste similar to Starbucks, moreso than other chains.Clean-up: Wipe the inside of the drink head, and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly ""splashy"" drinks.  No need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine, especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug.  Of course, you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low, so your first few times, you'll probably get a drip here and there.Final bits: We've had the Senseo since its launch.  Between pods that need ""pre-wetting"" to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks, the Senseo is lagging behind the Flavia.  We drink coffee, tea, espresso drinks, mixed blends, and sweet-tooth-friendly ""indulgence"" mixes every day with the Flavia, and it's brain-dead-easy to use.  Certainly easier to clean up after, too!  If you're on the fence between the Flavia and other single-cup offerings (like Senseo), get the Flavia.  Keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the Flavia.    I'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now, made over ice, and it's fantastic.  Highly recommended"
1718,kitchen_houseware,"This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee.That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives"
1719,kitchen_houseware,"Granted, it is a bit noisy at first (more like a shocking sound, not so much noisy), but you get used to it.  The mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill, especially if you've never used any of the larger office machines.  This was a complete first for me.  I mixed a few, watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes, but I got the hang of it and love it.  I commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at $2 to $3 a cup, so there's a huge savings in this product.  And the tea is the best I've ever had.  They actually add juice concentrates in the pack (some selections), so the tea is very flavorable.  The machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter, but I think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home.  It will always stick out at first.  I bought black and it looks great.  There really isn't any cleanup at all.  Other machines I looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons.  This really is so simple.  Finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter.  Because the packs are bigger than most pods, it is a challenge.  I ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry.  The round display rack that Flavia offers looks pretty neat.  I will definately buy that.  Over all, it's a perfect product in my opinion"
1720,kitchen_houseware,only problem i have with it...is that the plug doesn't go all the way into the power supply..which seems a little bit unsafebut works grea
1721,kitchen_houseware,"It was a joy not to have to hassle with those stupid cams and parts than don't fit (although the bottom feet, which you do have to assemble, had to be forced in order to fit). It's also quite attractive. I should pay more attention to the dimensions of products than to their pictures, because in my mind the picture makes it look wider than it is. It's nice to see real wood, but I am under the impression that the pressed wood like the stuff Ikea sells is more environmentally friendly. Finally, you can't beat the price."
1722,kitchen_houseware,"This is functional, yet very nice to look at and is extremely easy to put together.  It holds alot of DVD's or CD's and looks nice with any deco"
1723,kitchen_houseware,"This is my third mission collection item, and it lives up to the other two.  You can't go wrong with this collection.  I use it for picture frames on a small wall that seemed too empty.  It took nothing to assemble and is great looking!  Highly recommended"
1724,kitchen_houseware,"We have one, like a couple other reviewers here, in the dark color; we've had it for probably a couple of years.  We love it!  With our ever-expanding DVD collection, we went back to Target to get another one, and now all they have is natural.  Can't seem to find the dark wood one anywhere online either.  Can anyone help?!PS - I checked ebay too, with no luck.  I'm guessing nobody's selling theirs because they love it so much"
1725,kitchen_houseware,I have one in a dark color.  I can't find anymore anywhere.  Anyone know if they stopped making the other color
1726,kitchen_houseware,"I think this item is a great buy.  Well designed and very functional although I use it for my DVD's instead of CD's.  However, my DVD collection has extended beyond the capacity for one tower so I'm seeking to buy another but I wanted another dark walnut tower since the rest of my book shelves and my DVD tower I've gotten from Amazon are also in this color. Is there any way of finding this item in dark walnut"
1727,kitchen_houseware,"For quite a while I had been looking for a certain type of DVD rack/tower...then one day in Target I was looking at the Mission collection and saw the box (no display). It is exactly what I had been looking for. Slapped on the two foot ends and done! Perfect fit for DVDs, 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy DVD cases, like the ones New Line Cinema puts out, you can fit more. I don't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one DVD per slot. I have many oversized ones. The hardwood is great too, just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall. If you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then...it is worth it. I am almost ready to buy a third one soon"
1728,kitchen_houseware,"The Hoover F5914-900 is my first steam cleaner. It got my carpets cleaner than the model I rented from Giant, and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years. I did have problems when I tried to use the attachments. Water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected - might be user error. I will have to look for better hook-up instructions"
1729,kitchen_houseware,"We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners.  They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking.  We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet.  We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews.  I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America.  I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together.  We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack.  I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job.  Ok...our Hoover came.  My husband put it together and it leaked all over.  I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them.  By then we had already taken it to the repair center.  After a week they had not touched it.  My husband picked the machine up  and brought it home.  We decided to start from square one and put it together again.  He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!!  Yeah!  My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman.  So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first"
1730,kitchen_houseware,"Works very well. You'll probably want to pre-treat the carpet and also boil the water to get it extra hot, if the hot water out of your tap isn't that hot. Once you do that it works extrememly well."
1731,kitchen_houseware,"I have a 9' x 12' area rug in my living room from Pottery Barn.  With 2 cats, a dog and a 4-year old daughter, vacuuming was just not enough.  This carpet was also beginning to smell like my dog after a big rain -- yuk!  My husband was convinced that we should throw this carpet away.Boy, do I wish I took before and after pictures!  Immediately after the first swipe I saw something magical.  There was my beautiful carpet again!Aside from working wonderfully, it was easy to assemble and use.  Of course, I would have loved a bigger water tank; I changed the water once on my 9x12' carpet, but that's really fine.Also, be sure to read the instructions.  An area rug like mine should have plastic placed underneath of it to protect the hardwood floor while shampooing.  I just took a few garbage bags, cut them and opened them up.  And it was also a great deal.  Sears had similar models for $100 more.  Next I will buy the hardwood floor cleaner and scrub my floors with it"
1732,kitchen_houseware,"After having read the positive comments, I purchased the F5914 from Amazon and it was delivered this week.  I tried it today and I'm very pleased with the results.  Even though my den just needed to be ""refreshed"", I was amazed to see how dirty the water was.  I had brought home a Bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the Amazon comments were very negative so I returned it.  The only negative comment would be that the writeup in Amazon is not correct.  There was no bare floor attachment in the box.  I had to order one from the Hoover Store. But that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine. "
1733,kitchen_houseware,"I have really messy children. At the begining i thought about renting a carpet cleaner cause my carpets became very dirty  i thought that nothing will clean them exept a commercial carpet cleaner but when i decided to start poty training them i found that i have to own one at home.It's really great, it cleaned my carpets, It's easy to use  it's light.I use it all the time for the usual old accidents  the new potty ones"
1734,kitchen_houseware,"I rented the Rug Doctor to clean my area rugs on Memorial Day weekend and by July 4th weekend my carpets got dirtier in that time period than they got in their first two years. I think it was due to the soap, although I rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after I used the rug doctor soap. I was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because I was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again. This machine is easy to use. I had absolutely no problems with leaking. I did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet. I used two scoops of Oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses. No problems whatsover. My carpets got so very clean. It extracts very well also my rugs dried fast. I am so happy that I purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at Amazon."
1735,kitchen_houseware,"My carpets feel and look brand new after using the SteamVac!  I love how soft it feels, so I have been using the steamvac at least every 3-4 weeks.  The suction is great, and my carpets dry super fast.  I agree with the other reviews not to use more than half of the solution that is called for"
1736,kitchen_houseware,"After years of renting Rug Doctors, we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner.  We were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off-white carpets when they come in from playing.  Also one of them is a puppy, who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times.   After reading other reviews, we selected the Hoover F5914-900.  We wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the Hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner.  The carpets are as clean as with a bigger Rug Doctor.  We have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time.  We are very happy with our Hoover.  It is fairly light, easy to fill and empty, and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes.  As other people have commented, the attachment hose tends to fall off, so we just leave it off.   Otherwise, it's a heck of a deal!  "
1737,kitchen_houseware,"Since we heard nothing but bad things about hiring carpet cleaning services, we researched this SteamVac to replace that...our carpet had a lot of cat throw-up stains, and hadn't been shampooed in two years.  This thing was amazing!  It took out all the stains, and a ton of cat hair and dirt.  We continue to use it for spot cleaning cat throw-up (yes, she does it a lot!), and it is easy to use and clean up.  Very happy with our purchase, and now we can steam clean whenever we want without worrying about hiring someone to come into our house"
1738,kitchen_houseware,"This bookcase was fast and easy to set up, and it fits perfectly in the small space I have for it.   The one thing I would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves.   But that's not a problem if you actually put BOOKS on this bookcase."
1739,kitchen_houseware,This Mission Folding Bookcase is simply the best. Although I wanted a black bookcase but the natural is also great and it took me about 5 minutes to put it up since no assembly was needed.
1740,kitchen_houseware,"My husband and I purchased this shelf as a place to put my rather large collection of cookbooks.  We received the shelf within days of placing our order.  Upon opening, it took me maybe 10-15 minutes to take it from completely packaged to set up.  We liked it so much after a month, we purchased a second one.  We had the same positive experience with the second one.  The shelf is attractive as well as sturdy and affordable !"
1741,kitchen_houseware,The product came in a timely manner.  It was easy to set up and suits my needs perfectly.  I'm glad I purchased it
1742,kitchen_houseware,"What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn.  It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane!  The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape.I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition"
1743,kitchen_houseware,it was great and easy to install.  enough shelves for my stuffs. well it met my expectation
1744,kitchen_houseware,"I have bought 2 of these bookcases.  They are very well made, set up in 2 minutes.  Forget the pressed wood bookcases -- I have.  They sag and fall apart.  Not these bookcases.  They are solid wood, the real thing, and best of all, there is no assembly required, just unfold where you want it, and start filling it up! Also, very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again.  Excellent buy for the price.  Not made in China, I think it is made in Vietnam"
1745,kitchen_houseware,I bought 3 of these. They are a great addition to my natural PC table and 2 bookcases that I already had.The price is great too
1746,kitchen_houseware,"I have had this product for over a year and the bulb just burned out.  No cord problems, ever.  I use it every night in bed and it does not disturb my husband.  I have never had any problem with it.  It looks like, from the other reviews, that maybe I just got lucky.  Or, it's just that I have taken good care of it and never dropped it!  If I dropped it, I would expect that it would break.  I would highly recommend this product"
1747,kitchen_houseware,"Listen, I have bought several of these book lights, every time they break. It is not the bulb, or the plug or the batteries, it is the wiring. Don't bother. I am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes. Any suggestions"
1748,kitchen_houseware,"I am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product. I purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and AC adapter about 5 years ago and I am still using it. I replaced the light bulb for the first time (replacement comes in the set I bought) last year when it started flickering and died. The book light has been used a great deal and I have accidently left it on for full nights before. I am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage...This is the only down side I can think of. The battery pack has its advantages... you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive. I prefer using the AC adapter. This might be why I never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time. It fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks. You can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want. Over the last year, my boyfriend has bought at least 3 LED booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them. He has been stealing my booklight to read with and I am force to use the poor night stand lighting. The funny thing is... I had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a LED book light. Now I am on this page again to buy another one for myself"
1749,kitchen_houseware,"I have owned one of these little wonders for over five years.  During that time I have replaced the lightbulb one time, which is the extent of the maintenance or repairs that the light has required.  For people who are complaining that the light feels ""flimsy"", have you tried tightening the series of screws that allow you to adjust the tension between various parts of the light?  It's designed to allow for this sort of adjustment, but if you never tighten the screws they will eventually get loose.  Imagine that!  It's a moving part!  Seriously, maybe they've switched to a different supplier (although I doubt it), but my light is a joy.  It has proven durable over countless trips, moves, and drops.  It provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse to sleep undisturbed beside you.  Plus, unlike so many designs on the market, it is VERY lightweight.  Some designs inexplicably have the batteries housed in the unit, so that the batteries weigh down your book while you read.  I just don't understand all the negative reviews of this product.  The only thing I can suggest is: try tightening those screws periodically.  It will make a world of difference"
1750,kitchen_houseware,"I've gone through so many of these that I have lost count. For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again"
1751,kitchen_houseware,"Okay, I haven't used this while reading in bed yet...but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting, it's great! The light isn't good for areas that are adequately well-lit, so don't bother to use the light there. But in areas where light is dim, the light shines. Literally. It casts a bright light on the page(s) that you need to view. It's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading. Yes, it's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag. Imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go.  The power adapter, however, is a cumbersome brick. As for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for, I can't offer an estimate of time yet - but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so- cumulative, not consecutive hours. So, no complaints yet about that. Whenever I saw this light online or in the store, I used to think, ""Why in the world would I ever want something like this?"" Now, my thoughts are: ""Why didn't I ever think to buy this before?"
1752,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased one of these for my elderly mother.  It is very easy to use and works just as advertised!  The only problem we have had with it so far is once, when she tried to use it on a can with a dented rim.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting an electric can opener"
1753,kitchen_houseware,When i first got this item i loved it I used it 4 times and it stopped working
1754,kitchen_houseware,"Got tired of can openers that left little ""burrs"" or that were difficult to get started.  Hesitant about buying a ""As Seen On TV"" product, but went for it.  Works well, amuses my toddler and the dogs.  Overall happy with product, hope it lasts"
1755,kitchen_houseware,We are very pleased with this item and tried to purchase another just like it but you were out of them at the time
1756,kitchen_houseware,The worst part of this purchase was that it was a gift and sent to another persons address. That person now gets a  slew of catalogs at their address with my name on it. (They also get a second copy of the same catalogs with their name on it as well.)   Be prepared to have your name and address sold without permission if you do business with this 3rd party company. Bad business and aggravating
1757,kitchen_houseware,"This is the worse can opener I have ever bought.  It has failed four out of 6 times I have used it!!  When it ""fails"", it stops ""walking around the can"" and you have to locate a little screw and get a phillips head screw driver and turn that till the opener releases your can! Needless to say, I am stuck with a useless can opener and am out $20"
1758,kitchen_houseware,"Be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges...on the lid and on the can itself.  Otherwise, it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space"
1759,kitchen_houseware,"I was expecting a device that cut the roll-seam of the lid, but this one cuts the can just below the lid.  The resulting edge, while not razor sharp, is hazardous--in point of fact, the instructions warn, ""Note: The cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care."" contradicting the prominent ""NO SHARP EDGES"" claim on the packaging.On a typical can, the opener struggles to complete its task, coming to a near stop at times.  Of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life.  It has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical  303 can about 1-1/2 times.  For large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around.When the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can, there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can. There is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point, but if the reverse button doesn't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed, you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can--this manual release operation is challenging (and generally messy) to perform .The cutter--a sharp edged wheel--is not removable for cleaning, so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth (after removing the batteries).I recommend passing up this gadget"
1760,kitchen_houseware,". . . And we'll all have tea! That is exactly what this was meant to do.My wife likes to enjoy a nice cup of tea or hot chocolate when we are busy working outside in my garage workshop or doing what seems to be never ending yardwork.This is the perfect outdoor electric kettle to have on hand. We don't have to worry that it might break like a glass carafe would and we don't have to worry about turning it off. I just fill it up, put in on the tool bench, plug it in and wait for it to do its thing!All we have to do is sit down on the patio, admire Mother Nature and enjoy a good hot cup of tea!"
1761,kitchen_houseware,"I love and and bought one for my parents as well as my in laws....great for my morning tea. Favorite feature is the auto shut off, I can flip the switch, get ready for work and water is ready to pour. I don't have to worry about running to the kettle once the water has boiled. I highly recommend this product"
1762,kitchen_houseware,"Great little gadget for heating water. I don't have to monitor it since it has an auto off. The water is steaming hot, great for a tea drinker like me. Great price too!I bought this for traveling and heating water in hotel rooms. I have been using it at home so far. I am going to give it a spin (travel) this thanksgiving. Unbeatable, for the $10 I paid for it."
1763,kitchen_houseware,"The kittle looks good and I tried, it was not very fast but was accepted."
1764,kitchen_houseware,"This electric kettle is awesome,it boil water in no time.You can.t find any better one with this price!"
1765,kitchen_houseware,"It's great for the price.  So far so good.  Heats water fast, light weight"
1766,kitchen_houseware,"I love this electric kettle!  I use it 3 or 4 times a day to boil water for french press coffee, oatmeal, tea, etc.  I have not had the problems with the lid which others have mentioned- clicking it closed before turning it on is a no-brainer and I have never been splashed with water.It heats the water quickly even when filled to the Max level and the auto-shutoff feature has never failed.  The size is perfect and the detachable cord is a huge bonus.  I also feel it is sturdy enough. The light weight does not feel 'cheap', it makes it easy to handle even when full.Well worth the money; you will not be disappointed"
1767,kitchen_houseware,"So far I have been very happy with my Zo. I agree with others about the low baking temp...on med., my bread was much lighter than expected, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the loaf was undercooked. It was well formed and airy, just looked like I had baked it on a lower setting. Oh, but the shape of the loaf was perfect...looked like it came from a bakery (except with paddle holes on the bottom). The two paddles worked great, much better than my previous breadman and kenmore-no more scraping the sides-Ever!As far as needing more control, not sure why you would buy a bread machine at all. With my previous machines I only used the dough setting and baked in my own reg. oven...they weren't capable of baking an edible loaf. This machine does offer the Home Made settings that allows you to control rising time, kneading time, etc. If someone needs more than that, just make the dough in the machine and let it rise on your counter to your hearts content...hard part is done by the zo. Let's face it, if we were professional bakers, would we be buying a bread machine at all?Bottom line-the zo is an exceptional bread machine that offers more versatility than most, creates an attractive, well formed loaf, does a wonderful job of mixing the ingredients thoroughly with the two paddles, extremely easy to clean, and the zo has made it extremely easy to remove the pan-pull forward and slide out. I used to wrestle forever with my last one.One other note. Someone mentioned the pan warping...a little common sense will make this pan last for many years! Just read the manual. I have never had a problem with any of my machines, and this pan is significantly better than my last one that I used for 4 yrs."
1768,kitchen_houseware,I've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning.  We've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water!  It's a great saucepan and the price was great.  Highly recommended
1769,kitchen_houseware,"I was searching for a juicer for a long time and was contemplating the Jack LaLanne Juicer which my brother had. I came across this and was a little skeptical, but after making the purchase I am totally satisfied.I like the stainless steel construction, it is very well made, solid and sturdy. It comes apart very easy, and most of the time you just need to scrape out the left over and rinse with hot water to clean it.I can't believe i have gone so long without juicing, i've never been much of a fruit eater other than apples and bananas, but since buying this product I have made apple and carrot drinks, watermelon and cantaloupe, its great. I actually feel the difference inside within a short time.I read one review that this juicer leaves juice left over in the pulp, but i did not find that to be true. I think it all depends if your trying to force the fruit through to quickly. It you don't press to hard on the chute feeder and let the machine do the work the pulp is quite dry.I got one Litre of cantaloupe juice from one cantaloupe. I went out and purchased some 1 liter bottles and i just fill them up so i can mix and match to my aquired taste. I got 3/4 of a liter from about an 1/6 of a full water melon.Anyway i am thinking of purchasing one for my friend and his wife as a christmas gift.Great Stuff."
1770,kitchen_houseware,"This is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone.I am not in the habit of writing reviews, but this juicer earns it.Perhaps you are like me, and have never used a juicer before. You want to get one without taking out a small loan, because you just don't know if your that into it. If so, this is your juicer.There are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting. I just want to back those up with my experience. This is a good, strong product"
1771,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this steam vac a few weeks ago and have used it 4 or 5 times already on different areas of my carpeting.  I had little problem putting it together and have had no problems with leaks.  (And I am known to be mechanically challenged) I was most mystified by hooking up the hose and stair attachment but even managed that without great angst.I followed instructions by first using my regular vacuum over the area that I was going to clean.  Then I used the steam vac and the results were amazing. The steam vac did a good job on the areas where my elderly dog had peed a few times over the past six months. And the rest of the carpeting looks great after using this machine.  Since the carpeting was last (professionally) cleaned Oct 2005, I cleaned some areas twice.  I could not believe how much yucky dirty water kept coming out of the carpeting.  Also, the attachment that I used on the stairs brought up an amazing amount of dog hair-and I had just vacuumed the stairs with my Hoover Windtunnel.It's true that the tanks don't hold alot of water.  I had to fill the tanks 2 or 3 times to adequately clean a 10x15 area.  On the other hand, if the tanks held any more water, the machine would have been too heavy for me to easily use. Also, per other reviewers, I boiled water to fill about half the tank, then filled it the rest of the way with really hot water from the sink. Maybe that helped to get such good results. I was most amazed how quickly my carpeting dried- in many places withhin a few hours. Last year, it took several days for all of my carpeting to completely dry after being professionally cleaned.  Quite frankly, I think that the carpet looks just as nice now after I cleaned it myself. I couldn't be happier with my purchase"
1772,kitchen_houseware,"Just ordered two hand and two bath towels... cheap cheap cheap. You'd have better luck going to Target and buying the $2 towels. I assumed given the price of these that they'd be better... nope, they're junk. Don't be fooled. They're small. You can go to Target or Walmart and for $10 you can buy an oversized nice towel! Pass on these. I learned the hard way, now it's not worth returning them... guess they'll be good for cleaning and drying the car, ehh"
1773,kitchen_houseware,"I am sure glad I didn't pay $15 for these towels. I got them for $7.99 with a free hand towel, and they aren't even worth that much. Some of the loops looked like they had been snagged on something when I received them, I washed the towels and they have fuzz balls everywhere. The edges on some of the towls have came unstitched and are all fraid after only the 2nd wash. I would NEVER ever buy these towels again. No way are they 100% cotton and worth more then $2 a piece. These are junk towels I would use in my dogs crate"
1774,kitchen_houseware,"Similar to other ratings, I did find the towels a bit thin, but they are extremely soft and very absorbant. If you get the navy, you get the hand towel with it for free. It's a great deal. I've had no problems with them after washing. They are just a great deal. I'm really glad I bought them. The only thing I found odd was that they ship each towel separately. I ordered 6 towels and they came with 6 hand towels free. They were shipped in 12 separate boxed shipments. This didn't bother me as the shipping was free, but the UPS man wasn't very happy"
1775,kitchen_houseware,"The towel is thick and super-soft.  For its price, this is a very good buy.  I bought two, and even after washing, they are even softer and I love the towel.  The color (Blue Mist) is pretty and want to buy some more. "
1776,kitchen_houseware,"The towels are nice, soft and cozy. Wash before the first use and they will be a great treat when you are done with your shower/bath. I originally got cream and brown ones. The brown ones are fading slighty. I recently purchased blue ones and the color is staying for now. Otherwise, these are great towels to own. Good price for good quality."
1777,kitchen_houseware,"Like others I thought for the price and then the buy both and save it was a deal but these towels are still bleeding red in my washer and dryer and we are all ending up with burgundy fuzzies all over our bodies.  To top it off I still haven't received the hand towels that were supposed to be free with the set and it has been over a month.  Leave these (especially this color!) alone, do yourself and your family a favor and spend a little more and get better towels.  I'm going to through Penny's next time, a friend of mine bought the same color through them and they don't bleed or pill"
1778,kitchen_houseware,"I use this for my vacation rental. It holds up to washing really well, feels fluffy and soft. So my renters are happy with it"
1779,kitchen_houseware,"I haven't washed these yet, but they seem a little flat right out of the package.  This is a superb deal if you get the bonus hand towel, spend $125 and get 25 off, and then get free shipping.  However, I can not believe that amazon sent 16 boxes!!!  I ordered 8 bath towels and got the hand towels.  Every single towel was in its own box with some of those air bags to fill in the missing space where one or two more towels could have been easily placed!  What a pain! amazon must be doing pretty well to offer free shipping and send the items in individual boxes"
1780,kitchen_houseware,"I have several of these types of pans made by Kitchen-Aid and I absolutly love them. I purchased this loaf pan because it's half the price as Kitchen-Aid. Well, you get what you pay for! This pan is so flimsy, when you pour the batter into it, the sides bow out and you get a really odd shaped whatever you're making. Also, the sides cook and the center doesn't. Or you leave it in longer and the sides burn and the center cooks. Bottom line, silicone bakeware is great, but not manufactured by this company. "
1781,kitchen_houseware,"These filters are for use in the Braun coffee maker. They appear to work, coffee tastes very good. Can anyone really tell the difference from a maker that doesn't use filters"
1782,kitchen_houseware,Worked great. Didn't realize how better the coffee tasted with a new filter
1783,kitchen_houseware,I FOUND THESE FILTERS VERY HELPFUL INKEEPING A PURE TASTE TO MY COFFEE MAKER.THE USE OF THESE FILTERS ALLOWS ME HAVE FULL ROBUST CLEAN FLAVOR FOR MY  COFFEE.  I AN VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR                                 SATISFIED CUSTOME
1784,kitchen_houseware,The little Brita KWF2 is a compact and inexpensive water filter that improves the taste of my coffee. It would seem more or less effective depending on the baseline water quality that one uses to brew one's coffee. My Braun coffee maker was outfitted for this filter
1785,kitchen_houseware,"Brita makes a great water filtration system. I purchased a coffee maker that came with a Brita water filter in it. I thought what a good idea. This should make my coffee taste even better, and it does. The only fallback to this product is that it cannot be purchased all over. Amazon was the the only place I found it at a fair price. The filters are a bit costly but they do not need to be changed every month"
1786,kitchen_houseware,This is the same Brita filter that ships with the Braun coffee maker
1787,kitchen_houseware,"These filters are very easy to use, last a long time (2 months), and really improve the taste of the coffee I make in my Braun coffeemaker"

1789,kitchen_houseware,"I love my new Zojirushi rice cooker! I didn't mind cooking white rice on the oven or quick oatmeal in the microwave, but I really prefer brown rice and steel-cut oatmeal.  The problem was, by the time my wife or I got home to start dinner, it was too late to start on brown rice.  It was the same at breakfast - there just was not enough time to cook steel-cut oatmeal on weekdays, so I only had it on weekends.  I was not willing to pay $100 for a rice cooker, but when I read that it could cook oatmeal as well as brown rice, and it could do it on a timer, and that it could keep rice warm for several hours, I was willing to give it a shot.  If you follow the directions (rinse your rice!), it really does all of those things.  Rice comes out great every time (I have tried several varieties of brown rice), and so does steel-cut oatmeal (I use McCann's).  Rice will stay warm for many hours.  Clean up is a total breeze, particularly if you do it as soon as the bowl cools.  Since I bought it, I have discovered that my 1 and 1/2 year-old loves brown rice and oatmeal, so I have started setting the timer every night so that there is fresh oatmeal waiting for us when we get up.  If you can cough up the $100+, I would highly recommend this rice cooker. "
1790,kitchen_houseware,"I have the same usual story of woe; used a cheap, awful rice maker with a glass lid for years, had to deal with an awful mess anytime I just wanted a side of rice.I finally gave in and ordered this 3-cup rice cooker after doing a lot of research. It's as great as everyone says! It was just delivered this afternoon, and I've already pulled it out and cooked up some rice. It was so simple, I didn't even bother reading the instructions. The truly fantastic thing about it was, I was able to go run an errand that suddenly came up without worrying about leaving it sitting. When I got home, a *perfectly* cooked serving of rice was waiting for me.It is quite expensive, and I debated buying it because I'm moving to Japan next year. But I have absolutely no problem with spending the measely $20 to send it on over to myself.Admittedly, I am only one person, and never cook for more than 4, but I can't see this rice cooker failing to deliver for a small family of average eaters. I only made one cup (smaller than the '1 cup' we use in cooking), and it made a full bowl of rice.This is the first time I've ever bothered writing a review for anything--but I simply had to, because I am SO impressed. I would reccomend this cooker to anyone who loves eating lots of quality rice. :"
1791,kitchen_houseware,"My wife and I became busy recently and decided it was time to finally get a rice cooker to save some time in the kitchen.  We bought a cheap old-school rice cooker and the rice would scorch, water would boil out of lid, and the rice was worse than cooking the rice on the stove top.Then we decided to invest in a good rice cooker.The Zojirushi NS-LAC05 is everything we hoped for and more.  We wanted a rice cooker that would make great rice, that could handle smaller amounts of rice, that had a timer, and could handle a variety of different rices.This rice cooker is a dream.  -It's attractive.  We've already received compliments from guests.-Its footprint is very reasonable for a small kitchen.-With a thick, stick proof bowl the rice doesn't burn to any spot and clean up is simple.-It easily makes rice for 2 adults (1.5 of the ""cups"" for us) but could handle 4 adults (3 ""cups"") with normal eating habits.  Note: the cups aren't full size cups of rice.-It does a great job on a variety of rices; there are different settings for different rices and the measurement markings appear correct for different rices.  So far we've tried long grain brown, medium grain brown, sushi, jasmine, white basmati, brown basmati, and brown/white mixes.  We haven't had a bad batch of rice.-The computer's fuzzy logic algorithm (i.e. ""Micom Neuro Fuzzy"") constantly adjusts the temperature so the rice comes out perfect every time.  I also think the cooker starts out at a low temperature and gradually steps up the heat but I'm not 100% sure.-The heavy bowl seems to distribute heat perfectly and there's no scorched rice or crust attached to the bowl.-The timer is convenient for setting the rice to be completed at a specific time, at which point it keeps your rice warm.  We've found it completes cooking within a minute or two of the timer setting.  There are two timer settings that you can adjust...presumably so you could have your rice prepared for breakfast  dinner in Japan.-The retractable cord is a nice feature.-There's even a little holder for the included rice paddle that attaches to the side of the cooker.We've even used it to make Polenta.  Just use 1 Zojirushi-cup of corn grits, chicken broth up to 2-cup brown rice mark, and cook using the white rice setting.  When it's done, put the mixture in a bowl and let it cool to room temperature.I'd highly recommend this rice cooker.  It's probably not big enough for a big family but for a single person, a couple, or a small family it will probably fit the bill perfectly.  I can't over-emphasize the quality of rice the cooker produces...it's like a dream having rice as good or better than a restaurant at home.  We probably eat grain cooked in this machine 6-7 nights a week.  Once you switch to this Zojirushi you'll never want to go back to your old ways"
1792,kitchen_houseware,"Unacceptable!  Like others have written here, mine snapped in the dishwasher after the second use.  I complained to the company and was told that the box instructs ""hand wash only.""  Plastic that can't go in the dishwasher?  Meant to separate boiling liquids but not dishwasher safe?  For $8?  Garbage"
1793,kitchen_houseware,Not heat resistant - this is just to substantiate the other reviews - item cracked after second use
1794,kitchen_houseware,"Item cracked after first washing, useless after second washing. I'm going to try and find a glass one"
1795,kitchen_houseware,"Although I thought this product worked well in removing excess fat, it now has several long cracks in it and will have to be replaced in the very near future.  This is really annoying since I've only had it for a couple of months.  I plan on buying a [upgraded]glass separator"
1796,kitchen_houseware,How much can be said about a gravy separator?  It works as expected
1797,kitchen_houseware,"When making your Turkey gravy for Thanksgiving or when making any gravy, this is invaluable. Simply pour the juices into the gravy separator.  THEN.  Let it sit!  This allows the fats to rise to the top. When you pour out the juices they come out through the base of the spout, so all the fat gets left at the top. Stop pouring when you see fat starting to seep into the pouring spout. It really is that simple.  The handle doesn't heat up and it is very safe to use.~TheRebeccaReview.com "
1798,kitchen_houseware,"Over the past 40 years I've had quite a few pepper mills, this one is by far the best. Looks good, Works very good!  BUY IT NOW!!!"
1799,kitchen_houseware,It is pretty to look at and it really grinds pepper with great ease. I look every where for a pepper grinder that really works and finally found one.dilro
1800,kitchen_houseware,It is a wonderful product that cleans easily and bakes well so that cookies or etc. slides off easily
1801,kitchen_houseware,"Although this pan is heavy, it warps during cooking. (It's flat when cool, but once placed in the oven, it makes a sharp noise within a few minutes as one corner of the pan bends upward). I like my pans to stay even throughout the cooking process. I wouldn't recommend this one"
1802,kitchen_houseware,"Like the other Kitchenaid nonstick bakeware, this cookie sheet is made from very heavy gauge metal and, unlike Ecko and even Wilton, the nonstick coating is thick and durable.Don't gouge the surface with metal implements, don't overheat the the cookie sheet (450 F max), and don't use an abrasive nylon pad like a Scotchbrite to clean it.  The nonstick surface is so effective that there should be no need for harsh cleaning.  Even seriously baked on foods should come off after an hour of soaking in warm water.From reading the descriptions, I'm not sure what difference there is between this item and the Kitchenaid 17-Inch Slider (item K2901), other than the fact that I paid twice as much for this item.  I bought two of them, and they're very nice.  This is probably a lifetime purchase, unlike all other nonstick bakeware I've ever bought, so I'm trying not to be too upset by the price.  But for those still shopping, look for the 17 Inch Slider"
1803,kitchen_houseware,"I liked this kit. The lifter for the hot bottles was great. I used it whenever I canned. The magnetic pic up for lids didn't work as well as I'd hoped. The funnel was a good item, nice and wide to prevent slop-overs and messes. The bubble releaser was not an item I used much. The cookbook was pretty good and I used the stewed tomato recipe in it. I'm a first time canner, so I wanted to make sure I had the tools I needed. This was a good collection for a beginner and I'm glad I bought it"
1804,kitchen_houseware,"I have been canning for over 30 years and have canned several thousand jars of vegetables and fruit.  We fed our family primarily from the garden and orchard of our 2.5 Ac. farmette. I have used Mirro, Presto, All American and Fagor equipment.  All have their pros and cons.  You can use pressure cookers to can.  The problem is that at 15lbs psi (at sea level) your string beans will be better for the local nursing home residents than 3 bean salad. Of course if you live in the Pyrennees (Fagor is made in Spain) or an altitude calling for 15lbs to get 240 deg. that's what you want.  The 10 qt duo pressure has a fixed choice of 8lbs (not 10) or 15.  8lbs only gets you to 234.4 degrees (unless you live in Death Valley or the Dead Sea area).  The bacterium which secretes the botulin toxin is killed at 240 according to the USDA. You also need the high temp to kill certain enzymes in certain foods like creamed corn which everybody with a freezer freezes today instead.  But I have not had a problem with the string beans at 8 lbs.  As for the tomato/onions/bell pepper/garlic/basil mix, my wife starts cooking this in the afternoon so all the bacteria is dead by the time I come home. I can it by boiling water bath (have canned over 1,000 qts.) to kill the airborne yeast in the headspace.  Fagor makes quality products, even though the people writing the instructions have never canned in their life. This kit fits the 10 qt. unit. If canning is new, ask around at church or a retirement group for help.  It's more fun and easier to learn that way. -Canner from Lancaster Co., P"
1805,kitchen_houseware,"I love the funnel! Very sturdy and durable. The canning rack fits into one of my smaller stock pots which is nice for smaller batches. This is a nice set. They include a book with some recipes and color pictures. Beware if you've never canned before, The pictures under the ""steps for pressure canning"" were taken by someone who had no clue. Step 2. shows jar of food with someone removing bubbles, step 3. wipe rims of jars... shows empty jar turned upside down with someone wiping it, step 5 shows how the magnetic lid lifter works... except they are using it after the ring is on!. Anyway this is a great set anyway"
1806,kitchen_houseware,"it's not only the best canning tools, it's also compact enough to utilize the small spaces I have in my apartment"
1807,kitchen_houseware,This is an excellent vacuum for the money.  It is very reasonably priced.  The suction is excellent for carpet.  The only drawback is that it is not self-propelled but tht is not really a problem as the vacuum moves quite easily.
1808,kitchen_houseware,"I just love my Tempo vaccum.  It's a simple machine inexpensive machine that gets the job done.  I've only recently purchased the machine, but have been very impressed with how good it picks up the dirt, hair and paper.  It cleans my rugs and carpet beautifully!!"
1809,kitchen_houseware,"This inexpensive upright vacuum does a good job on rugs but is less efficient on other surfaces such as bare floors.  It is relatively quiet, operates smoothly, and is light-weight so it doesn't wear you out."
1810,kitchen_houseware,"I bought the U5140-900 through Amazon after reading the reviews. I have been pleased that the overwhelmingly positive reviews are absolutely right - this is a wonderful vacuum cleaner, especially considering the price. The suction is very strong and catches almost everything (including my son's toys(!)). It is built very well, not flimsy or plasticky like some I have seen. Negatives: It is very loud but I can deal with it, given its efficiency. And I wish it has a retractable cord."
1811,kitchen_houseware,"I did my homework, read the reviews, and LOVE THIS SWEEPER...  I had a Hoover previously, and it lasted 9 long years - I run the sweeper at least once a day in a busy household.  This machine is amazing - it is lightweight - easy to put together (within minutes)- picks up EVERYTHING  filters very, very well - it has fantastic suction - The cord is 20+ feet  the on-board tools are very handy and easy to use and put away.  I am so very glad I made the choice for this one!  Easy to find and clean filters  they are re-usable - no need to buy more at high prices - simply pop out clean  dry and pop back in... Super!  A1 in my book"
1812,kitchen_houseware,"For the $70 price, a great vacuum:pro:-low price-great suction-great cleaning results-rated 'very good' overall by leading consumer magazine-no HEPA filters to replace, rated equal to HEPA-models in dust/particle emissions in leading consumer magazinecon:-I am 6'3"", the handle is a bit short for comfortable vacumming-Attachment hose is shorter than mos"
1813,kitchen_houseware,"Our 6-year old Panasonic died (motor armature burned out) and we replaced it with this Hoover.  Weight and performance are comperable to the old Panasonic ($160 new) and it's an incredible bargain at $60.  I am giving it only 4 stars because although it's about as loud as the Panasonic, the sound is higher-pitched and is, to my ears, more annoying.  No problems so far after 6 weeks of use"
1814,kitchen_houseware,"I was just about to write a review detailing how this vacuum worked great at the start and after a week it stinks.  The thing is, this cleaner is so strong that the first day I had to empty the bagless bin four times.  There was such a build up of dirt that all 3 filters, and the area with the rotating brushes were completely clogged with dust and hair.  The hand hose didn't suck anymore, and I wasn't sure if it ever did.After cleaning all the filters the cleaner works great again, and this cleaner had incredible suction.  The hand attachment also works great now.  How often will I have to clean the filters?  Its hard to say and it was quite annoying to clean all three, one of them was only accessible after removing a screw on the inside.If hoover had given a bit of a better warning about cleaning the filters after the first several uses I would have given it a 5 star rating.Some other reviewer noted that on floors, the dirt just gets fired all over the place, I was having that problem too, but now that everything is clean, it works great once again"
1815,kitchen_houseware,"I've had experience with quite a few vacuums (kirby, dirt devil, generic pieces of crap, etc), and this one is the best so far.  Suction is great, it's powerful and does get to those corners well.  I actually like where the on/off button is, it's really easy for me to reach.  I've only had it about 2 months, but I have nothing but praises for it.  It's quite light, which is good for smaller folks like me who can't lift 100 ton vacuums.    Assembly instructions were easy and quick, and I feel like I could quickly and effectively change or fix the belt should it ever break or malfunction (which it hasn't so far).  Overall, it does a great job, just as good as any other bagged vaccuum, in my opinion.  I hope this review helps someone because the previous ones helped me to pick this product. Thanks"
1816,kitchen_houseware,"I was thrilled to get these knives on sale. They are lovely and even have their own case. Once I figured out that the groves within the case were at an angle to keep them in place I was quite pleased. I wish that they were straight edged, but it's a small complaint considering that these are nice quality steak knives."
1817,kitchen_houseware,These knives are a wonderful touch to setting an elegant place at the table. No rough looking giant steak knives here. These knives cut through steaks of various size and texture with ease. Even used in a casual setting these knives fit in. Very tasteful as well as useful.
1818,kitchen_houseware,Call me lazy but I have discovered that this steak knife set makes a wonderful wedding gift and have bought 4 of them in the past six months. You can't beat the combination of quality and beauty when giving this set as a gift ! The price is right and I get rave reviews for my choice on every thank you card
1819,kitchen_houseware,"I was a hippie vegemite until I received these bad boys as a wedding gift...  Yeehaw!  Haven't tried cutting through a tire with em', but they mow through your toughest cut of meat.  Love em'  Love to show them off.  Neato"
1820,kitchen_houseware,"Apologies to those who don't like ""cute"" appliances, but this little fan definitely qualifies. It is barely over 5"" high, and can almost hide behind a pencil holder. For its size, the cooling capacity is surprisingly good, and it even has two discernable speeds. It is all plastic and may not last forever, but while it does, and at this price, it is the perfect little desk fan"
1821,kitchen_houseware,"All the other girls in my office are jealous of my adorable tiny fan! This little fan is the perfect size for my desk, and I imagine anyone's cluttered desk can afford the small space it takes. It sits directly across from me (2 feet away) between my pencil cup (shorter than my scissors) and my phone. It has an acceptable noise level: I can talk on the phone with no problem.  It doesn't blow my papers around. But most importantly, it keeps me nice and cool, happily blowing on me to fulfill its destiny!  A good purchase"
1822,kitchen_houseware,"Please trust me, although I may not be an EXPERT on coffee, I know ALOT about espresso.  I have worked in the coffee business for over 5 years. I have tasted the good, the bad, and the ugly. I drink espresso and espresso drinks regularly.  Through my years of drinking espresso I beleive there are two things essential to the perfect cup. 1. The beans must be dark, oily, and finely ground. They must be of the highest quality you can afford. 2. The most important....your machine must be a REAL espresso maker.  Forget about those combo coffee makers.  Forget about Name-brand department store machines...they all have one thing in common.  The espresso always tastes weak and you cannot control the strength of it.  These ordinary machines cannot give you rich espresso topped with Creme( a frothy rich creamy foam that floats atop the perfect espresso).  This is because no machine, except for industrial high-tech machines used in coffee shops, can carry the pressure necessary to create the perfect espresso. This machine can! I have used one, searched for one for YEARS...even looking in Italian papers...and here it is right at Amazon!  If you are looking for perfection...you've found it!  The hand-pull design allows you to control the strength of your espresso..thereby giving you superior tasting espresso drinks as well.  I would give this machine 10 stars because you would have to go to Italy to find such a high quality machine..honest....I really do know this stuff.  If you have any questions regarding this machine, espresso, or anything to do with quality coffee please feel free to email me.  Espresso fanatics..this is a MUST have"
1823,kitchen_houseware,"Never expected it to be so difficult to find a high quality mini processor for everyday use. The Cuisinart looks good but that's it. As Janet D. said, it purees some of the food while leaving some large chunks - in the same batch! I am returning the Cuisinart tomorrow."
1824,kitchen_houseware,"I have not been happy with this product.  In fact, I am considering returning it or selling it in a yard sale.  It does not chop the vegetables (onions, peppers, etc.) in a consistent way.  It either makes puree out of them or leaves large chunks that must be chopped up by hand.  I have another little mini processor that is cheaper than this one, and it works a lot better.  I bought this one because of the Cuisinart name, and I have been really disappointed"
1825,kitchen_houseware,"I'd recommend to buy this one.  This one chops very good specially garlics, onions, etc.  It lasts long too.  Our previous last about 6-7 years"
1826,kitchen_houseware,"My wife wanted this for very simple tasks in her Thai restaurant. She opened the box, wiped/washed the vessel clean, dumped in some garlic and fresh chilis, and hit Play. It worked like a charm, and is still doing it a month later, heavy-duty, even though it is not specifically rated for such commercial work. It is precisely what she wanted, and does exactly the task it says it does. There are no drawbacks, actually, but I give 4 out of 5 because - be careful washing this little baby, the blades (surprise!) are sharp."
1827,kitchen_houseware,"I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.  I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI  LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.  One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blade missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.  Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it. "
1828,kitchen_houseware,"If you mainly use a food processor, or WANT to use a food processor for blending, chopping and pureeing foods, the Mini-Prep is such a good idea. It does about 80 percent of what a large food processor does, and it's easier to clean and takes up less space.If you find you typically chop herbs, make pesto and blended sauces, herb butters and the like and do NOT use the food processor for batters, doughs and slicing, you might consider the Mini-Prep. The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp. I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato, dried tomato, oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture (chopped but not liquified.) One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl. If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect. It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too. The unit comes in steel color and white. Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process. If you do coffee, smoothies, pesto, chopped herbs and nuts and salsa, this may just be enough, saving you dollars and space"
1829,kitchen_houseware,"This little thing is awesome! I have had mine for 2 years and it never fails me. If you want to chop things like peppers, onion, garlic...or make a small batch of homemade salsa, this gadget is the one to do the job. I have the large food processor I use for the big jobs, but 9 times out of 10, this is all I need. It works great for combining spices to use as rubs on your poultry, beef, etc. Anything to save a little time in the kitchen. Great performance"
1830,kitchen_houseware,"This is a MINI processor, and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs, I have the ""big boy"" to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs, so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick, as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices, etc. however...but it states that in the manual"
1831,kitchen_houseware,"After reading the negative reviews I felt I had to put my 2 cents worth in. For what it's worth, I've owned a mini-prep for about 8 or 9 years and have been extremely happy with it. While I acknowledge that it does not do the best job of chunk chopping, it does do a great job on emulsions, spices and (especially) garlic butter for garlic bread. By processing in small batches and pulsing on low, you can get acceptable chopping for salsa ingredients, etc. The one thing I do stay away from is grating cheese. I tried it once and thought I was going to kill my mini-prep, I grate by hand. As far as clean-up goes, you need to use a glove, dish rag, or (my personal favorite) sponge to remove the blade from the shaft so you don't get cut by the blade. As long as you don't try to make it do the work of a machine 2 or 3 times it's size the mini-prep is a great little processor. You wouldn't try to tow a house trailer with a Mini Cooper would you?"
1832,kitchen_houseware,"Easy to wash, nice sharp blades. The blades are a little hard to clean safely when bits get caught, but mostly it just washes out in water. Chopping isn't that even but it does a good job if you keep shaking between the chopping. Does a great job with nuts and hard things, not quite so good with softer things (like bell pepper). Overall, well worth the cost"
1833,kitchen_houseware,"I ordered this item because I wanted another one of the jumbo slotted spoons, and I decided to get a few of the spatulas.  The jumbo slotted spoon is a MUST HAVE.  I use it for absolutely everything.  It's so easy to use: flipping, stirring, scrapping, scooping, etc.  Because it doesn't melt, I can use it on the stove in hot oil, boiling candy, etc.The small and medium spatulas are good for scraping out pans and bowls and make a nice addition to the slotted spoon"
1834,kitchen_houseware,"Helps tenderize meat and allow the flavor of your marinade to penetrate deep inside. Running it under some hot water cleaned it right off. Even though the products with more blades would probably work better, this is a great buy for someone on a budget"
1835,kitchen_houseware,"These glasses are absolutely beautiful!  The blue ball at the top of the stem looks like a jewel against the amber top.  The only downside is that they cannot be washed in the dishwasher, probably to preserve the iridescent glaze.  A great buy"
1836,kitchen_houseware,"This is a great product for storing dog food.   The wheels are sturdy and make it easy to maneuver the bin when filling it with food, or moving it to get food out of it.  It seals securely to keep food fresh and keep out bugs (and anything else that likes to snack on pet food.)  I don't use the treat bin on top of the dog food container, b/c I found it too cumbersome on the lid, but use the treat bin separately.  I highly recommend this product"
1837,kitchen_houseware,This product has made our life so much easier. We make applesauce from our own apple tree and it used to take days. Now it takes only hours and is fun to do.
1838,kitchen_houseware,I am most pleased with my purchase of the VillaWare V200 food strainer.  It performed just as it was described.  I especially liked the ease of cleanup.  Expect some splatters as the food is processed
1839,kitchen_houseware,"But this is the real deal.  I borrowed one from my brother to make homemade applesauce this afternoon.  We started at 2:00 with a large laundry basket filled with apples and by 4:30 we had produced 28-16 ounce containers, cleaned up the mess, and bought a strainer for ourselves on Amazon.com.Our kids love the homemade stuff, but prior to using the Villaware strainer my wife had spent 6 hours one afternoon peeling, quartering, de-coring, cooking and filling eight applesauce containers.  Now with three little kids at home, we will be able to do four times as much--and be done before they wake up from their afternoon naps!It assembles and cleans up easy, although the red plastic push rod may not hold up over time.  It cranks easily enough if the apples are parboiled, but my arm was getting pretty tired after doing it for an hour and a half.  Sure it's work, but it isn't a waste of time--and time is what I seem to need the most!My brother shopped for a good strainer a long time before settling on this one.  He runs EVERYTHING through it, and wanted to be sure it was well built and would hold up.  He also has additional screens that I do not believe will be coming with the model above and are currently out of stock.  For $40, it pays for itself the very first time you use it"
1840,kitchen_houseware,"This food strainer is not the fastest in the world, even with the optional motor...but it is well built and will last for years.  It is hard to beat the price and the wonderful job this machine does.  Consider you can put raw tomatoes in and it spits out the skins and seeds...how much is that worth to you?  $40 is a cheap price to pay for this item and you will be happy with the results...just realize operating it by manually cranking it is not easy, it is work.  If you want something easy, go to the store and buy your tomato or apple sauce.  If you want the satisfaction and quality of homemade, use this strainer"
1841,kitchen_houseware,"This is my first year canning, and because I'm a bit lazy I didn't want to have to peel anything, let alone strain it by hand to get all the seeds out.  I ordered this Villaware fruit and vegetable strainer to give me a hand with peaches and tomatoes.  The instruction booklet helped me put all the pieces together, although the clear plastic funnel that shoots the seeds and skins out after the juice and pulp are extracted and pushed through the strainer is hard to attach, and I'm afraid it's going to crack each time I put the machine together.  Cleaning the parts was not half as bad as I expected.  After all is said and done - this is definitely the way to go!!  This strainer gets the job done with minimal effort and is a real timesaver!!  I'd recommend it to anyone who's going to be canning lots of tomatoes or, if you're into the natural stuff, making your own baby food"
1842,kitchen_houseware,"I also have the old original version of this gadget.It would do 8 bushels of tomatoes for me every summer. Cleaning the strainer was the hardest part but weighed against the dollar savings,it was well worth it.My hubby melted my spindle years ago and I've  been unable to replace it. Its a great machine. I used to set it up on picnic table outside and the kids in the neighbourhood would love to help me. In one 16 hr day I could master 2 bushels with their help. Its nice to see a newer version on the marke"
1843,kitchen_houseware,"I have one cat, and my neighbor has 3.  We both own this item and it is our lifesaver!  Anyone with hardwood floors knows that feeling of the tiny pieces of dirt that you can feel on your feet when you walk bare-foot.  I can't tell you how annoying it is to walk on a pebble of kitty-litter on your floor (not to mention gross).  I used to lug out my huge vacuum cleaner 3 times a week to get the small pebbles around the litter box, or the tiny pieces of food around the food bowl.  This item picks it all up!  From broken pieces of catfood, to cat hair under the bed and in the corners of your house, to even cobwebs in the corners of your home, this saves so much time and energy!  It's pretty powerful for it's size.  My neighbor and I swear by this little life-saver"
1844,kitchen_houseware,"After reading the bad reviews for the shark vacumms, I got this black  decker one.  I have used other hand vacs that lose power pretty quickly, but I can use this one and walk through the house without it needing recharging. It even sucks up dog kibble!  It is very easy to empty as well."
1845,kitchen_houseware,"I just LOVE this Dustbuster.  I had a previous model by Black  Decker, but this one is MUCH better.  PLUS....and this is a BIG plus, you can wash the filters!!!  I have two parakeets and use this to clean up seeds and other 'messies' from them.  SO....the filters get clogged at times with small seeds, feathers, etc.  I just twist them off, separate them, spray some cleaner on them, and wash them very well under a strong blast of hot water with my bath tub faucet....I even use a fingernail brush on the hard plastic one and it cleans out the tiny holes.  I just let them dry, and it cleans like it is NEW. It will also go for 3 or 4 days with using it off and on every day without having to put it back on the charger. When/IF this every goes out on me, I WILL buy THIS model again!"
1846,kitchen_houseware,"Just got the 9.6 volt model V9610 about a week ago. Overall I like it a lot. It might seem a little large at first, but is handy to use and well balanced. Suction on the high setting is impressive, while the normal setting still provides plenty for most things. Emptying it out is easy, as is cleaning the filter. Be sure to read and understand the instructions for charging it before use. The manual says it'll run 10 minutes between charges. Seems to do better than that to me. It's a lot easier to pull out of the craddle when wall mounted, so I suggest you use the supplied screws and drywall anchors. I took off one star for that and the switch being a little on the stiff side. I definitely recommend this model over the lesser powered ones for the good suction"
1847,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this a week before Thanksgiving. It is amazing! Easy to use, and easy to clean up. The only downfall I can think of is that the parts are NOT dishwasher safe, but it's not that bad. I have used 2 of the 3 attatchements, and it was simple. It doesn't matter how often you would use it, it's definately a kitchen staple!"
1848,kitchen_houseware,I absolutely love this mixer and it is easy to clean. You can use it for just about everything too. I have had mine for about 5 years already and it is still holding up. I love to cook and am happy this is in my kitchen.
1849,kitchen_houseware,"This little baby delivers on every single level. It does the job better than any mixer on the planet.  It's built like a tank.  Look awesome.  And the price is an amazing value for the money.  For the years and years of enjoyment and pride you will get from this machine, it breaks down to the very best present money can buy"
1850,kitchen_houseware,"I've enjoyed mine for 15 years, my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years, not sure how old my grandma's is, all still run great. Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter"
1851,kitchen_houseware,"My wife loves this mixer! Easy to use, great price, works like a charm! I wasn't sure two years ago about this for a Christmas gift, but, she loves it and I reap the rewards! Just the cakes and brownies alone are worth the price! LO"
1852,kitchen_houseware,I purchased this mixer a couple of months ago. I have used it several times and love how it works.  I had purchased the mixer based on Kitchen Aids reputation and on reviews submitted by others. I purchased the Artisan model over the larger model based on those reviews.  I am very pleased with the Artisan model so far. The reviews I read were right on the money. This mixer works as advertised. I would highly recommend purchasing the Artisan model Kitchen Aid Mixer
1853,kitchen_houseware,AFTER 36 YEARS OF MARRIAGE AND MANY MIXERS WE FINALLY PURCHASED A KITCHEN AID MIXER -  MY WIFE SAYS IT IS THE BEST SHE HAS EVER OWNED -  THANK YOU AMAZON.COM FOR SUCH A GREAT PRICE
1854,kitchen_houseware,I love using it - its just a pleasure to bake having this proffessional hefty machine. Every cook shoud have one in their kitchen. Kitchen Aid is a quality mixer
1855,kitchen_houseware,This is a wonderful machine.  I have owned 2 other mixers in my married life but this is the best.  It's quiet  gets the job done
1856,kitchen_houseware,This cake pan made the moistest most scrumptious cake I have ever made in my life! This pan is unbelievably awesome!
1857,kitchen_houseware,"This has been the best cake pan!  We found this out by accident. A friend at my brother's work baked him a cake for his birthday. She let him bring the rest home, pan, and all.  Before he got it back to her, his wife and I needed it to bake multiple cakes for a family function. We used her Wearever Airbake pan. It was great!  No burning, the cake baked even on top, no sticking to the pan. Yes, we greased/floured the cake pan. Clean up is also easy.  Well we did get the pan back to her! lol  But we each bought one for ourselves. p.s.  if we bake a cake for someone, we make sure the pans don't go with them"
1858,kitchen_houseware,AirBake products are horrible! I have used the cake and cookie sheets multiple times and I have had nothing but problems. There products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans. I have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than AirBake. Buyer beware! If you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature
1859,kitchen_houseware,"I have quite a collection of ""inherited"" cast iron and always enjoy using it.  This little pot is great because it is just right for frying up a few french fries or chicken tenders for the kids, or can be pulled into service making a side dish for about 8 people.  I used it for baked beans as soon as I opened it and they were GREAT!  I have had it about 2 weeks and have used it almost every day!  Last night, we roasted sweet potatoes in it and they were marvelous"
1860,kitchen_houseware,"I'm a mountian girl from the Blue Ridge Mountains in SW VA. I remember Granny use to cook the very best food I've ever eaten. Granny use to tell me it was the iron pan that made it taste so good. After Granny passed on, I got a cast iron fryer. But I had no idea how to care for it, barely used it and finally threw it away.Lately I've been reading about the possible problems with teflon, and in the process I came across information on Lodge Logic Pre Seasoned Iron Pots. I remembered Granny's cooking, so I purchased 3 different size fryers. The first thing I cooked was bacon and eggs. Oh my, that was the best bacon and eggs I've eaten, since Granny cooked them for me. Well, I writing to tell everyone, Granny was right. It is the iron pans that makes the difference. Now, I have a big collection of every piece I could ever possible need, from fryers to dutch ovens to griddles, to muffin pans, etc. I've also noticed that Paula Dean uses a lot of Lodge cookware too.Yes, they are a little more trouble, and yes they are heavy, expect that, after all they are cast iron. And I've had to lower the heat just a little and move the food around just a bit, in the pan while the food is cooking. But, the taste of the food makes it a pleasure to take care of them; and [...] will tell you exactly how to do it. As for the weight you don't have to do much lifting; from cabinet to stove, to sink, back to cabinet. If you don't have a medical problem, then you should be able to do this without problem. If you can't, then you need the exercise, so get them and use them. And, this recommendation goes for the whole line of Lodge pre seasoned iron cookware. Here's wishing you all, Happy feasting! "
1861,kitchen_houseware,"This is my second piece of Lodge Logic cookware. I love these pans. Easy clean up, and easy to prepare great food in them. The pans also seem to be top quality, though only time will tell how long they last, but I anticipate having them for many, many years"
1862,kitchen_houseware,It cooks rice very well but a bit of work to take care of it
1863,kitchen_houseware,"Preparing food for 2 or 3 has never been easier with this little pot from pot roast, chili, stew, etc. I'd suggest to get the 5 quart one for bigger family"
1864,kitchen_houseware,A nice pot to cook soup or something liquid for a family of 4. I like it
1865,kitchen_houseware,"After reading the positive Amazon reviews, I took the customers' advice and ordered 2 of these little pots.  I usually cook for one or two and these are an ideal size.  I probably want/need two more as with their included lids, they are perfect for small meals in an oven.  Follow the crowd and get at least two of these jewels. "
1866,kitchen_houseware,"I paid $14.95 for this in May 2005 - it's my favorite piece of cast iron, and I use it like a mini dutch oven. It's good for roasting garlic, and it camps well. The lid fits on a smaller cast iron pan that I own as well"
1867,kitchen_houseware,"This is a great pot -- so great in fact that within a half hour of its delivery, I was ordering a second from Amazon.Think of it as: a two quart Dutch Oven; an 8 inch wide, three inch (almost) tall skillet WITH LID; a braising pan for a couple of chicken breasts; a sauce pan; a casserole dish. This is a lot of pot, especially for the price!I'd given up on cast iron because I could never seem to get and keep the iron seasoned.  But Lodge's new preseasoning solves my problem -- I'm now replacing all my cookware with Lodge Logic (the fact it's an American company makes me even happier).  THANKS, Lodge"
1868,kitchen_houseware,"I love my Polder Stainless-Steel Paper Towel Holder with Spring-Loaded Arm. I've had one in my kitchen for about two years now, and it has become such a fixture that I simply cannot imagine anything else holding my paper towels. It is great at keeping the roll from unravelling too fast in those grab-and-go situations. The only thing is, as the roll gets down there, the spring loaded arm doesn't really do much anymore and becomes... purely decorative"
1869,kitchen_houseware,"My two favorite food preparation vessels are the unlined copper bowl my wife gave me as a Christmas present, and this Anchor Hocking batter bowl.  When we get together in the kitchen, you just know that a batch of Belgian waffles, pancakes or cornbread is on the way.The bowl is made from thick-walled oven and microwave safe glass and includes a cover for use in the refrigerator or microwave oven.  The cover also doubles as a bowl rest, catching any dribbles of batter before they hit the countertop.  The sloping sides help you get a hand mixer's beaters into every drop of your batter and the handle provides rock-steady control when you pour.  The molded-in quantity markings allow it to do double-duty as a 2-quart measuring cup in half-cup increments.  The clincher, of course, is that the bowl and cover go right into the dishwasher after the last waffle is baked"
1870,kitchen_houseware,"A solid, hefty knife, no question and I love the way it feels in my hand.  When I was buying my knives I couldn't see how anyone could possibly justify spending two to three times more for the Henckels and the Wustofs.  Now that I've had it and the 10 chef's knife from the same line for about 6 months, I've noticed a few little things about them that might make it worth buying the big names if you obsess over knives or are likely to get sucked into a knife obsession in the future.  1) If I hold the blade perpendicular to my cutting board and look at it from the side, I can see a little daylight at the belly of the knife.  There is about an inch of blade where it just misses making contact with the cutting board because the curve in the edge isn't quite uniform.  I first noticed this when I was chopping up some mint leaves and realized that some of them were left intact unless I used a slicing motion as well as a vertical chop.  I have a hunch that this wouldn't happen with a truly well-made knife.  2)  They get very sharp, but they don't seem to hold their edge for more than about a month or two.  I sharpen using crock sticks, and give the blades a few swipes on a steel about every fourth time I use them, and I'm not cutting anything out of the ordinary.  Again, I suspect a top-drawer knife might do better.  3) Last, if you look carefully, the finish is not as nice as that on more expensive knives.  You can see what I suppose are grinding marks on both sides of the blades.  All in all, I think these are amazingly good for the money, but I'm no longer as mystified about the higher prices of knives with more established reputations"
1871,kitchen_houseware,This is a great little chef knife. I got it as part of the 2 piece set with the bird's beak parer(also vary handy). I liked it so much I went ahead and bought the 15 piece set. I haven't had any problems with it yet. It sharpens well and maintains the edge. The overall form is slightly different than the 8 traditional chef. There is also room in the 15 piece block for this knife also
1872,kitchen_houseware,"Whether you are considering the Dipping Set as an introductory purchase or as an addition to your existing Sango Splash dinnerware set, you won't regret it.  This set is beautiful.  Even if you aren't a collector of the Splash pattern this would most certainly make a wonderful gift or serve as a terrific stand-alone piece.  The set has an earthy hand-made look and feel.  The colors are rich and the contrast between the shiny glaze and the flat finish ""pottery"" is appealing.  Above all this unique set is sure to be a conversation starter. "
1873,kitchen_houseware,I have a few pieces of Emile Henry and look forward to getting more.  They clean up so much easier than Pyrex ever has for me.  They look brand new all the time!  And the colors are fabulous.  I had a piece break in half while roasting veggies.  I called Emile Henry and they had me ship it to them at not charge to me.  They inspected it and replaced it for me at no charge at all!  Because of the customer service I will continue to purchase Emile Henry
1874,kitchen_houseware,This was the perfect good-looking replacement for boring Pyrex and I used it often - until one day it suddenly cracked right down the middle while I was roasting a small turkey breast in the oven. Makes me completely wary of purchasing another as they're quite expensive. I have a similiar roasting dish from Cost Plus that's made in Portugal and is still going strong. Wish I could find more of those instead. (much cheaper
1875,kitchen_houseware,"**Please note that I have posted a similar comment about the chef's knife elsewhere on Amazon since I use that one a lot.  I wanted to make sure anyone just looking at chef's knives would get the benefit of my experience.Wow, I bought this starter set of 3 knives back when I worked in a local Italian restaurant in college.  I cut and prepped all the veggies and fruit.  One of my other duties was sharpening all the knives in the kitchen.  After being frustrated with all of the low cost Sysco knives since they were never sharp and could never be sharpened, I noticed that the boss always had his own knife - at first a Henkel and then a Global.  I decided to invest in my own knife for restaurant work.  This starter set was what I found on sale and I can't tell you how please I was (and still am) with this set.  Out of the box - they were so sharp I was scared, but I eventually realized what the phrase ""a sharp knife is a safe knife"" really means, because prep work with the chef's knife was a dream.  I bought a plastic holster for the blade so I could use it myself.  But every other cook in the kitchen wanted to use my chef's knife.  The chef's knife feels GREAT in your hand while you are cutting which is due to the shape, balance, shape and material of the handle and the full tang blade.  I would also like to comment these knives have an attractive classic look to them.  I still have the same set of knives 7 years later and occassionally take them to a professional knife shop for sharpening.  What else can I say? I love these knives and will probably buy a full set if I can find one that has everything I want.  Oh, I forgot about how great the price is - I have used Henkels, Globals and a few others and I can tell you if you keep these knives sharp you will be just as happy so you don't need to spend all of that $$ on the so-called higher quality brands.  Chicago Cutlery has outdone themselves with the Centurion line"
1876,kitchen_houseware,"I also purchased the Churchill China Brook Blue set of 8 (45 pieces) and the completer set, intending to have a matched set of 12. WRONG. The set of 8 was indeed made in England and contained soup bowls (listing on Amazon only says ""bowls""). The set is very nice and has high quality. The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the ""bowls"" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England. Suggestion: if you want consistancy, order two sets of the 45 pieces and don't fool with the add-ons. Amazon could not guarantee the ancillary pieces would be from England.... despite the on-line description to that effect"
1877,kitchen_houseware,"The set I received did not match the written 'Product Description' though it did match the picture.  The set included the 6 3/4 inch bread  butter plates  the 6 inch cereal bowls instead of the 8 inch salad plates  8 3/4 inch rimmed bowls (as described September, 2005.)  Thus, unfortunately it doesn't match the 45 piece dinnerware set (8 place settings) of the same design which I also ordered.  Having said all that, it is still a very nice set. The 6 inch cereal bowls will probably be used more often in our family than the rimmed bowls.  The quality seems very good  it was packaged securely."
1878,kitchen_houseware,Item exactly as promised. Price was higher than local store that had same pattern but was no longer carrying item. Most items we order on internet ship within 48 hours so we thought a 7 to 10 day wait was a bit long
1879,kitchen_houseware,Chirchill Brook Blue is a very elegant china made in best traditions of the 18th Century aristocratic Europe. High quality - made in England. I enjoy it in everyday dining as well as for formal gatherings
1880,kitchen_houseware,"How come people think kitchen basters, and especially the large-sized turkey basters are so funny? What's the joke? Am I missing something here"
1881,kitchen_houseware,"Very stylish and clean up is a snap. I have bought every piece to complete the entire set. For the price, why buy anything else"
1882,kitchen_houseware," I have been slowly building a Cuisinart collection. I am extremely pleased with the value and performance of these pans. I have had the 2qt saucepan for over a year now and it sees frequent use. Great to make home made gravy, sauces, soup, leftovers, or to heat some veggies. I use this pan occaisionally for making rice as well. The pan heats quickly and evenly, the handle stays cool enough to handle, and the non-stick surface holds up well. I stick to wood and nylon utensils as any non stick surface can be damaged by aggressive metal utensils. If your looking for a non stick sauce pan buy this one. You'll love the performance and the look. Nice see through lid to watch your veggies too. If used on a long simmer with lid, the lid will get a little hot so keep a pot holder nearby to lift it. Cuisinart makes some great cookware"
1883,kitchen_houseware,"This pot is great I have used it to make rice and mac n cheese, both come out great in this pot. No sticking. The topper on this pot was I made cranberry sauce in this pot and it came out great and clean up was a breezes"
1884,kitchen_houseware,This sturdy pan is great for heating up soups and I also use it to stir fry veggies. The nonstick coating works well and I haven't seen any scratches yet. Heats up quickly and evenly. Just make sure you use wood or nylon utensils and keep it medium heat or lower.
1885,kitchen_houseware,"For the price, we expected an ""ok"" knife, but instead found this knife to be superior to many others we own, including Cutco. We are glad we made the purchase. Delivery was very timely"
1886,kitchen_houseware,"Well, gee whiz! All the negative press these under-rated knives are getting! I managed to slice my fingers (DEEP!) spewing blood...just trying to get them out of their packaging! They're plenty sharp alright!I didn't find them at all flimsy, wobbly or thin! On the contrary, I found them to be stable and sturdy with just the right amount of ""heft"". Makes me wonder WHAT people are trying to saw thru with these knives!The knife blades are riveted to the wooden handles,the blade edge is serrated for a good sharp cut, and they DO cut very well!For the price, for everyday use, these knives are a great deal"
1887,kitchen_houseware,"Buying on-line has one major drawback and that is the inability of the buyer to test the product before making the decision. Whenever your purchase comes as advertised, you have made an excellent buy. This knife set qualifies as just that"
1888,kitchen_houseware,"Eating steak has never been easier with these beautiful Eversharp steel steak knives.  Choosing the right knife to cut your steak is important because a dull knife won't get the job done.  You'll be cutting at it for a long time and not get anywhere.  That's where this wonderful set of knives comes in.  They last a long time before losing their sharpness, too.  "
1889,kitchen_houseware,"We purchased these new knives about 2 weeks ago. The price is excellent, and the quality is superb. The tangs (that is the metal part of the blade that goes inside the handle) goes right to the end with 3 fixtures keeping in place, making these a very solid knife.They don't weight too much, and the handles are not too chunky. Add to this, the extremely sharp blades, and you've got a winning combination at a price you can't beat!- Dave"
1890,kitchen_houseware,These steak knives cut through steak so easily---it is hard to believe that you are cutting meat.  I would highly recommend the Henckels steak knife set.  I ordered this set to go with the full Henckels knife set that we had already purchased  found that this is truly the best set of knives we have ever owned.  Most likely this will be the last set we need to purchase since they stay sharp  are extremely well constructed
1891,kitchen_houseware,"henckels is the best.  will never buy any other.  The best steel, love the way they cut great balance. you cant beat the price.   luv luv luv them.    Rose Petit"
1892,kitchen_houseware,"We've had our set for 3 years and we love them. They cut like scalpels. I like that they are lightweight and don't take up a lot of room. Also, I have a delicate platinum-rimmed china pattern and if I need to have steak knives on the table, these fit in with all of my other tableware."
1893,kitchen_houseware,"The Chef's Choice Pizzelle Pro Express Bake is fast, and very easy to use and clean.  The measuring spoon and ready light take the guess work out of making perfect three cookies at a time.  The thickness of each cookie is consistent, because of the fastener clip.  I have used two other manufacturer pizzelle grills and found the Chef's Choice is far superior  and reasonably priced. "
1894,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this to make pizzelles for a travel program I was doing on Italy. The pizzelles came out nicely and were good. I used one of the recipes that came with the baker. Be sure to use the small measuring spoon that comes with it--it does give you the right amount for each pizzelle--even so, some of mine were ragged--but that just confirmed that they were homemade. Cooks fast and evenly. You are warned in the accompanying literature to be careful that the top of the baker will get hot--it does!  Guess how I know that?  I would buy this maker again--I'm pleased with it"
1895,kitchen_houseware,"EASY TO CLEAN, EASY TO USE. DELICIOUS PIZZELLES. AS FAST AS I MADE THE PIZZELLES I ATE THEM! WOULD YOU SAY I LIKE MY OWN BAKING? BUY IT, YOU WILL BE PLEASED"
1896,kitchen_houseware,"Lasted about a month. Then the hook broke off. The metal of the hook looks soft and brittle, not even the same quality as a common hardware variety hook.Also the stand has an annoying habit of disassembling itself when one lifts the banana off the hook.Also the little hook looks cute, but seems poorly angled to make hanging and unhanging a bunch of bananas easy.Guess I am not impressed with the function of this product"
1897,kitchen_houseware,"This is a great bottle.  My only complaint is that mine came with a large hard-to-remove brightly colored warning label on it... warning not to use it for hot liquids.No problem, I thought I would just peel it off.  But no, it wasn't that easy as the adhesive was very strong.  Soaking it for two hours in hot soapy water did nothing and I had to do two applications of an industrial strength adhesive solvent, some scrubbing and final cleanup.  I guess they may have had some legal problems with people scalding themselves. But if they're going to 'permanently' apply a label like that then it should show on the picture.One of the reasons I paid that much for a water bottle is that it looks good.It also works very good... keeps stuff cold all day.The directions say not to put in liquids with pulp, as the pulp particles may cause it to leak.  This is true.  The tiny pieces of pulp get into the lower rubber seal and cause it to dribble down your chin.  This was a problem for me, as the main drink I like to bring with me on hot days is lemonade.  But, I found that the dribbling can be avoided by putting the lower cap on first and then filling it through the narrow drinking spout using a small funnel.  It's really easy, and well worth the extra little inconvenience"
1898,kitchen_houseware,"I like pretty much everything about the bottle -- except for the primary reason that I wanted it, which was to use while driving in my 1997 Honda Civic. Admittedly, the Civic has a poorly designed cupholder, but I figured that one of the beverage containers in the Nissan line would be import-car-friendly. Nope. The bottle is way too tall for the Civic cupholder"
1899,kitchen_houseware,"There is saying that goes, you get what you pay for and in this case it is true.  Sure, there are other sports bottle that are less expensive but they do not get the job done correctly.  I don't drink soda but I love seltzer water so when I saw that Nissan made a carbonated bottle, I was ecstatic.  The 1 pint carbonated bottle is the perfect size, not too big but small enough to fit in a car cup holder.  And for non-believers, the soda, beer or seltzer water does stay cold for hours.  I filled up my bottle on a Friday night with ice and seltzer and could not finish the drink and the next day, the ice and seltzer was still in bottle.  It had not melted at all.I have a tried most Nissan products and I would not consider buying any other product when it comes to coffee mug or sports bottle.  They are really worth the money."
1900,kitchen_houseware,"I've been using the 1-pint carbonated bottle for a couple of days and its 1-liter big brother for a couple of weeks now, and have found them to be almost perfect for keeping soda cold and fizzy.  Fill them up, drop in a single ice cube, and you'll have cold, non-flat soda for at least eight hours.  They come with a double screw-top:  the smaller top section unscrews for drinking, and the larger (red section in the 1-pint version) for filling and adding ice.  Full-size cubes won't fit without some re-sizing, but the slice-shaped product of refrigerator ice-makers fits perfectly.  The drink opening is about 3/4 in diameter, while the fill opening is about 1 1/2 wide.  The only slight drawback I've encountered is that it takes a couple of tries to completely fill them from a 2-liter Coke bottle because of foaming, but that problem is common to all stainless-steel containers.  The top includes a safety gasket, similar to the safety gasket in some pressure cookers, for those who ignore the instructions and leave the bottle out in the hot sun for extended periods with highly-carbonated beverages.  Finally, the bottles are intended ONLY for cold beverages, as use with hot beverages apparently can result in leakage and scalding"
1901,kitchen_houseware,"While looking for a way to have a cold drink without paying obscene prices for water at my university, I stumbled upon this container. At first I did not know what to think about its effectiveness in maintaining a very cold bottle of water, but I purchased it anyway. After receiving the 16-ounce version from Ebay, I quickly realized that my water remained relatively cold for at least 1 day. I was shocked and amazed that such an inexpensive item could maintain such a low temperature for a long period of time. Yet problems occurred. For one, the opening is way too small to fit any kind of regular sized ice cubes, sometimes a metallic taste is observed in the water if not washed for a few days, the rubber around the bottle begins to slip off if you spill water on it (as I have many times trying to aim for that little hole), and finally it is not leak proof. Those are not such grave concerns since I put in extra small ice cubes, try to wash it often, better my aim at small openings, and not keep the bottle upside down. In addition, by not being leak proof I mean that during the day one may notice that the bottle would have some kind of ring of water around the mouth even when closed, but at least the whole thing did not sweat out water just as a regular water bottle would. Nevertheless it is sturdy since I have dropped it several times and have seen no dents or scratches and it is an added bonus for this container to keep soda crisp. For those that want a quick and handy water bottle that is perfect in every way, this is not it, but it comes close. I recommend going for something with a bigger opening and a guarantee to be leak proof, however if the issues above do not seem so dreadful, this bottle will be fine"
1902,kitchen_houseware,"This bottle is attractive, easy to clean, just the right size and best of all, it REALLY works.  Carbonated beverages stay carbonated for hours and hours.  The contents stay cold and bubbly for what seems like forever, the outside doesn't sweat and it fits in a car or carseat cup holder.  I love it and I will be buying several for gifts.  If you have any use for a water bottle, this is the one to own"
1903,kitchen_houseware,It is so nice to get into bed with these sheets under you
1904,kitchen_houseware,"As seen on TV should be a red flag for everyone.  I thought I had learned my lesson before now.  Hope lives eternal.  I think this is such a good idea, BUT it just does NOT work.  How do you get the bags out from under the bed when they expand again?The vacuum didn't even last over night!! "
1905,kitchen_houseware,"I bought the space bags for expensive comforters and pillows I will never sleep on them, they are just for show. I became tired of changing the pillows and sheets on my bed everynight. I fit all of my pillows and comforter in the JUMBO SPACE BAG. It works wonderful for what I needed it for. Now when guests come I can Open my spacebag and like magic all my pillows are ready to use. It's my first time using them so I hope they dont ruin my pillows since they are very expensive pillows. My only problem is the travel bag that you squeeze air out of the zipper broke and I can understand why some people are annoyed at the quality. As far as the plastic goes it gets the job done it could be a little thicker but once you seal an item it's pretty strong. THE ONLY REASON TO BUY THESE IS FOR BULKY ITEMS. Sweaters, Blankets, Pillows, and Shirts. Fit as much as you can NOT GOING OVER THE LINE and seal. At first I tried 1 pillow and was not impressed then I put 7 pillows and comforter and it worked like a charm. I should note some of the pillows were smaller then the usual sized pillows"
1906,kitchen_houseware,I've been using the Space Bag for over 2 years now and I have NEVER had a problem with them. After reading some of the reviews below it sounds to me like no one is paying any attention to the instructions! You can put what ever in that bag so long as you DO NOT fill it above the lines instructed on the bag! And the bags do compress rather well. I'd give the Space Bag 5 stars. It's helped my family greatly
1907,kitchen_houseware,"Just from personal experience. Don't buy this stuff, it does not work well at all:-1. Does not compress more than 10%. If you only have gigantic sweaters and pillows, maybe more, but for the most part, it will be 10% MAX. For example, the totes don't shrink enough to close! Totally defeats the original intention.2. Very flimsy material. One mistake and it is torn. For all the care you may take, if you rub it against the wall, it pops a hole. Even Walmart plastic bags are more resilient!If you ONLY want to have airtight bags (you don't care about the space savings and treat the bags like a one day old infant) then probably it may make you happy. Otherwise a big big big waste of money"
1908,kitchen_houseware,"If you have cats, and we do, you have to be able to store the bag INSIDE a closet that the cat will NEVER get into, or they are useless. If a cat even jumps on them ONCE, you are done for. If I had room in the closets to put all this stuff, I wouldn`t need the space bags. Store under the bed? No way. Cats can and do go under the bed. I even had one stored in a closet where it was doing OK, and opened the closet briefly and the curious cat pounced inside, and -- boom --- there goes the space bag. These would be a fabulous idea if they were a little more sturdy and dependable"
1909,kitchen_houseware,"I have read many of the reviews and all I can say is:  I have used these bags for comforter sets, summer/winter clothing, xtra pillows, hanging clothes(off their hangers), xtra sheet sets, our camping sleeping bags, quilting projects and atleast six trips by car and by plane - I THINK THEY ARE GREAT!!!  They are not a stuff, suck and throw product.  If you do not overstuff - are willing evenly zip the zipper being careful to start at the very end and completely remove the air and seal imediately - you will have sealed your stuff indefinitely!  I cannot wait to try the newest hanging ones.  So if you are one of the few people not in a hurry, expecting immediate gratification for a rushed job - go for it, you will love 'em"
1910,kitchen_houseware,"Ok, we bought Space Bags for the same reason as most people: save space on seasonal items. We loved the space bags since it did the job. However, I noticed how some people's bags would leak, therefore defeat the purpose. Always follow the instructions. My bags has lines across the bags telling you not to go beyond the mark while stuffing clothes in. This prevents overstuffing and air leaking. It hasn't given me any problems. Once I heard the leaks people were talking about but that's because I tried to overstuff it. Took a coupld of sweaters out and no more leaks. It's been sitting in my closet for 2 weeks now still looking the same when I vacuumed the air out. We're moving in two weeks so we order 14 more bags online. We were satisfied with this product"
1911,kitchen_houseware,"I would rate this item --0 stars.  I purchased 4 large Spage Bags and the zipper only works on 1 of them.  I have zipped and re-zipped these bags dozens of times and they just will not stay zipped.  This is the biggest rip off I have ever seen.  I have called customer service for help but I can never get through because of the ""high call volume.""  I sat on hold for 1 hour and never spoke to a live person.  Finally a message came on and asked me to leave a message and they would call me back.  They still have not called me back.  If you have money to burn go ahead and purchase this item but you will have to either return it and pay postage or throw it in the trash"
1912,kitchen_houseware,"It really does work!  I call it a true time saver because at the same time that the machine is reaming out the citrus fruit, the stirring bar does a good job of mixing the sugar/sweetner into the lemonade. "
1913,kitchen_houseware,"I've been making a lot of fresh lemon and lime juice lately for parties, to mix drinks with. Using a hand citrus reamer often takes 30-45 minutes, and is a lot of work to boot. I eyed this reamer at the store several times, but never bought it until this weekend. I am so glad I did! This thing allowed me to juice about 20 limes in 8 minutes (yes I looked at the clock). No need to warm the fruit up first, or strain it when you're done. The device was strong enough to do the job of completely reaming out all the citrus, way better than I could ever achieve by hand, even with a hand-held reamer. And I never broke a sweat."
1914,kitchen_houseware,I really like this pizza cutter.  Easy to clean.  Easy on the wrist and arm.  I've bought two or three to give away.  We also use it for cutting our granola bars. Nothing else like it!!!
1915,kitchen_houseware,"I have been using the Toddy Maker over 10 years, after I moved south for awhile.  I was introduced to iced coffee and the cold brew method by a friend in Grad School.  I have been hooked ever since.  It is very simple to use and tastes much fresher than the concentrates you can by in the grocery.I mainly use it for iced coffees, but it does make a great, fresh-tasting hot cup as well.  I must admit, I need the aroma of coffee brewing in the morning, so use my Tassimo for the hot drinks"
1916,kitchen_houseware,"This system easy to use, produces outstanding if not superior coffee.  I give it 4 stars because I cannot take this great coffe with me in a thermos.  It's an inherent characteristic.  The recommended procedure is to combine 1/3 uber coffee (what the Toddy system produces) with 2/3 hot water.  I agree this produces a wonderful cup of coffee.  However, 1/3 refrigerated liquid and 2/3 just off the boil water produces a tepid product that is great if you want to drink it now but is too cool to spend half a day in a thermos.  Again though, one great cup of coffee"
1917,kitchen_houseware,"I had switched to tea because I could no longer tolerate regular brewed coffee.  The acid was tearing up my stomach.  A friend suggested Toddy because of low acid content.  I was hooked immediately.  Once you try it you will never be able to stand a brewed cup of ""acid"" again.   The coffee tastes great no matter how many times you reheat it.   The best cup of coffee you will ever drink"
1918,kitchen_houseware,"If you love coffee, but don't want to feel acidy and oily....get a Toddy.  I have been using a coffee Toddy since I first started enjoying coffee (18 years now).  You will not get a smoother, ""cleaner"" cup of coffee.  You can choose how strong you like it by soaking the grinds longer, or simply adding more ""extract"" to your cup.  When we serve our guests our Toddy coffee...they are immediately hooked.  Buy it...you will never go back"
1919,kitchen_houseware,I'm still using my original 12-year-old Toddy Maker and have added one more. I make 2 containers at a time. Here are the benefits:1) Make it one day and use for 2 weeks 2) **Consistent** rich flavor -- I use Starbucks Espresso Roast and room temperature bottled water (room temp provides better flavor than ice cold water)3) Perfect for iced drinks because it's cold from the fridge (good for hot as well -- just micro and add water to taste)4) No waste due to coffee left in the pot (you use only what you need)5) Low acid -- no stomach distress eve
1920,kitchen_houseware,"The low acidity of cold-brewed coffee reveals a wealth of other flavors that were previously overwhelmed by  acid harshness. Cheap beans will be less harsh than before,(they will still be less than ideal), while good beans can almost taste like chocolate, and even the strongest coffee is so mellow that those who  are used to using cream and sugar may no longer need to"
1921,kitchen_houseware,"The Toddy is fabulous, and so is the coffee that comes from it. I have a lot of stomach problems so drinking brewed coffee or espresso is a lot like playing Russian roulette. Not with the Toddy! The concentrate even works great for recipes calling for espresso, and as an added bonus, it doesn't have the acidity! You can easily clone all of your favorite coffeehouse recipes because this stuff has the versatility of hot or cold, strong or weak, etc. I'm also the only one in my house that drinks coffee, so this way there is no waste since the syrup keeps for two weeks. If I have friends or family that visit, it is easy to make coffee for them instead of brewing a bunch of 1 cup batches. Not to mention, a pound of coffee every two weeks is a heck of a lot cheaper than using those pods every day. I'll admit, there is a trick to unplugging then immediately putting it on the decanter, but it's easy with practice. That's where the handle comes in handy, hold it with one hand, and pull the plug over the decanter with the other. Not rocket science. Also, if there is ever a power outage, you can still get your coffee fix"
1922,kitchen_houseware,"The Toddy Maker Cold Brew System makes a really smooth cup of java.  In fact, it is the smoothness of it that will immediately catch your attention. You may even wonder if you like it at first!  My main reason for trying the system is ACID REFLUX.  I had given up trying to drink even one little cup of regular brewed coffee a day.  Desperate for caffeine, I tried the Toddy and IT WORKS!!!!  Yes, I have to admit to missing the smell and the hissing and gurgling of my Senseo machine, but I have been drinking coffee daily for over 6 months with no ACID REFLUX (and no urinary infections!!!!)  I ordered from their website.  You can get a free maker if you join their coffee club which you can quit after 3 purchases.  They have great coffee and I have yet to experiment with other coffees.  Another advantage is that I can mix 1/2 regular and 1/2 decaf when I make a pot.  It is a little messy at first, but you will learn how NOT to dump grounds all over the place with patience.  I highly recommend this product....it is not HYPE!!"
1923,kitchen_houseware,"I don't know what these other people are talking about. I used this twice just to make sure I hadn't messed it up the first time. The coffee wasn't any different (in fact, a little worse) than if you hot brew a really strong batch and keep it in the frig (which is what I usually do). It's also messy and uses a lot more coffee than hot brewing. I wish i could return it, but I've already used it"
1924,kitchen_houseware,"I've been using the Toddy cold brew system for 9 months and it's perfect for the way I drink coffee. The taste is much smoother and less bitter than most hot brewed coffee and the smooth taste lasts even when cooled or reheated in the microwave. There are also no dregs or residue so it actually is ""good to the last drop"". The taste is different than hot brew, though, and takes a little experimentation to find the type of bean/grind and ratio of concentrate, water, milk, and sweetener that works for you.I like to have one cup of coffee before and after work, and occasionally one at work. Since the Toddy produces a 10 day supply of refrigerated concentrate (per my usage) it's much more convenient than brewing two single cups a day. The ""at work"" cup can be made at any time without worrying about the degradation of a hot cup in a thermos. Cleanup is also easy since the carafe and brewer just need one trip through the dishwasher every couple of weeks - no daily cleaning of coffee pot and filter.I only have two very minor complaints about the Toddy. First, the simplicity of the process is great, but the design is maybe a little too simple. I'd like to see the rubber stopper replaced with a system that works while the brewer is in place on top of the carafe (as it is, the brewer is held with one hand while the stopper is removed with the other, then the brewer quickly placed on the carafe). Secondly, since the brewing takes 12 hours, there is a narrow window each morning/evening in which I can start the brewing and know that I'll be home and awake at the right time to finish it - not a complaint about the Toddy itself, just one area in which hot brewing provides a little more convenience (during these times between Toddy batches, I use the Black and Decker Infuze vacuum brew system, which produces the best tasting hot brewed coffee)"
1925,kitchen_houseware,"I love Shun and I love these kitchen shears.  The whole thing is very heavy duty and feels of quality and durability.  If you open it up all the way, it unhinges very easily for ease of cleaning.  When you put it back together, it's solid again.  It's very easy to do and does not sacrifice sturdiness.  These are all purpose kitchen shears and I can't think of any improvements.  The handle is made of some heavy duty plastic that's lines for non-slip.  It's very rugged and utilitarian, but I'm not that hot about plastic.  Luckily, it looks good and the quality and feel still can't be beat"
1926,kitchen_houseware,"I was drawn to this timer because of it's somewhat retro, stylistic look. Unfortunately, only one of the timers on it worked. After reading ratings in Cook's Illustrated, I have decided to go with a digital readout thermometer which they recommend. Save your money and get a digital timer"
1927,kitchen_houseware,"OK, I have other Henckels knives, and like them all, but this is the knife that quickly became the one that I turn to first for all but the biggest slicing/chopping tasks. The size of this knife is just right. The blade is a good length for so many garden variety kitchen tasks, and the handle and heft just feel good and solid in the hand. The superior sharpness has been easy to maintain with an occasional swipe on the steel--even after much use. I like and use it so much that I have started giving it as a gift item. Everyone loves it"
1928,kitchen_houseware,"If you are only going to buy one knife for your kitchen, this is the perfect one.  Great for most kitchen activities, sharp, good weight, excellent construction.  I highly recommend it"
1929,kitchen_houseware,"A few months after buying and using this brush, *all* the bristles fell out in one big clump.  Yikes"
1930,kitchen_houseware,"the bristles come out non-stop. oxo took back my first, sent a replacement, which proceeded to do the same thing. shoddy build on this item, stay away. That said, OXO has great customer service and other products I've used are better"
1931,kitchen_houseware,"When the clan rolled in to Chez Snerdley for Thanksgiving 2003, I had no worries about serving them a prize Turkey.  Why?  Because I had coated that thing with my secret recipe baste.  But that's not the whole story, because that baste would have never gone on as smoothly or evenly without this gem of a basting brush.  Because of this Good Grips item, I was free to focus on my other priorities: green bean casserole and Jell-o salad (the latter of which gave 2 relatives food poisoning, unfortunately).Thanks to OXO for making such a quality product!  Everyone's already asking me for my baste recipe - I'll just tell them to talk to the brush"
1932,kitchen_houseware,"Run, do not walk, away from this brush.  I don't know what type of glue they used to hold the bristles in but it must be the Post-It Note glue"
1933,kitchen_houseware,"I have almost all of the good grips accesories and I think they are great. But not this basting brush. Everytime I use it the bristles come out and I end up picking hairs off my food. I am so afraid to use it when I have guests because I don't want them to think I am losing my hair in their dinner. I threw mine away. Good Grips, invent a better basting brush and I will still buy it! :"
1934,kitchen_houseware,"This is a quality brush. Great design meets great utility. So far, no fallen bristles. It's OXO at their best. Come to think of it, I might get two or three and use them for shop duty as well. This is a great brush (buy two, if one is used up,order another while the second is in service)"
1935,kitchen_houseware,"This brush was great for awhile on my grilled stuff, as well as on all of my baked items. Unfortunately after about ten washes half of the bristles came out at once! Oy. Don't buy this one unless you don't want something that lasts"
1936,kitchen_houseware,"I am a stage performer as well as a chef.  I specialize in contortion and throwing knives (often with my feet).  I use the Wusthof so much in the kitchen, that I thought I would incorporate it into my act.  I throw the knives at flying fruit and vegis and perform flips with knives between my toes and fling them at my assistants. Throwing knives are usually smaller, perfectly balanced, and forged from one solid piece.  They require perfect tang as well and incredible strength.  Wusthof is the ONLY high-end kitchen knife that meets these requirements.Although I have several chef's knives (global, henckel, wusthof, etc) I prefer the Wusthof both in the Kitchen and on Stage. I would never bring the Henckel or any other brand.  Wusthof has absolutely perfect balance and tang.  The difference from throwing knives is that kitchen knives usually have handles added to the forged steel.  Unlike any other high-end brand, Wusthof's handle is extremely durable. In practice, I broke all other brands of knife, both handle and blade.  I was surprised that my Henckels did not last very long (the 6"" 4-star pro's blade snapped in half and 8""'s handle came apart on one side). The quality of a Wusthof really shows when you use it for something it's not meant for and is still extremely reliable.  And as you can read in all the other reviews, it is very sharp. In case you're wondering, I've never injured an assistant, but I did slit my foot open one time. I also stuck a head of lettuce to a vaulted ceiling"
1937,kitchen_houseware,"A chefs knife will be your most used Knife in your collection.  Why would you want to pay a lot of money for one?  Expensive, high quality knifes hold their edge (sharpness) longer.  After almost 6 months of daily use, mine needed sharpened ($3 for a professional to sharpen it).  You should also invest in a honing steel.  This will not sharpen your knife, it will only realign the blade and keep it sharper longer.Before you buy any knife though, feel it in your hand.  The weight should be evenly balanced.  You hold the knife with your hand wrapped around the handle, with your thumb and forefinger on the blade.  This will feel weird at first, but you will have a lot of control.  A knife that ""feels right"" to me, may not for you.The first time I used this knife, I was amazed at how easy it cut through chicken.  No sawing action was needed, just a gentle push.Be wary of buying a knife set.  The next most used knife you will own will be a paring knife.  After these two knifes, the quality of the rest is not as important.  Each knife should feel comfortable to you though.After owning this knife for a year I also purchased a 10 inch (""wide"" model) Wusthof Chefs knife.  A longer blade means less work and faster chopping.  The 8 inch now feels small to me ;) A sharp knife is safer than a dull one.  Be careful with your non cutting hand, I sliced my lower knuckle a few times when first using this.  Hold the item you are cutting with your pinky (smallest) finger and thumb.  The tips of your other fingers should be curled out of the way.  The knife rests flat against your curled fingers.  Go slow, you will eventually get the feel for it.So, before investing in a high quality knife, try out different models and manufacturers.  These knives will last a lifetime (and probably your children's).  You will not be disappointed with Wusthof if you decide to buy these knives"
1938,kitchen_houseware,"This review is principally for those who, like me, believe that you can get good quality without spending a lot of money, or who are just plain averse to spending a lot of money on anything.If this describes you, and if you like to cook, I have this to say:  Sometimes, you do have to spend money to get good quality.  Or, for the really averse: Get over it.A general-purpose knife is an essential tool for any cook.  You can certainly get the job done with the cook's knives that come with the butcher-block sets you find in most stores for under $100--the ones with the polished stainless-steel blades or the serrated edges and the lifetime warranties.  You may even find a set that includes a knife that makes cutting, slicing and chopping easy.  But you will soon find that either your cook's knife can't keep a sharp edge or requires too much effort to cut things.  In either case, you will soon find yourself looking for a new set of knives.For the price of one of those butcher block sets, you can buy this knife instead.  You won't regret it.  One really good cook's knife, like this Wusthof, is worth all those other knives in your butcher block put together.  The combination of excellent balance, weight and fine edge make chopping and slicing a breeze.  (Another reviewer mentioned techniques that give you even more control of the knife.) And with proper care, this knife will give you a lifetime of pleasure in the kitchen.Cook's knives are one product category where the costlier items are really the better values.  The Wusthof Classic knife is worth every penny of the $120 suggested retail, which makes it a real bargain at Amazon.com's price of under $90"
1939,kitchen_houseware,"I've been reading about,  drooling over, various high end kitchen items for a few months: Le Creuset, Wusthof, etc. And reading all the consumer reviews. Recently, I finally sprang for a set of Wusthof knives that I got at a good price on one of the auction sites. So far, the only knife I've used is the 8"" Classic chef's knife. After 20-30 years of using cra*ppy kitchen knives, this was.......like a revelation. It's easy to think all these rave reviews are somewhat hyperbole; but they're not. Comparing this knife to any of my old beat-up knives is like comparing a Porsche 911 Turbo to a 10 year old Hyundai. BTW, I sprang for the 10 pc. Classic set. I'm still not sure if that was a good idea, or if I should have just gotten the 8"" chefs knife  saved a couple of hundred $$. But the thing is, if you want even 3 or 4 of the items in one of the sets, like the ""big"" oak block for instance, maybe the bread knife, or whatever, it really starts to add up (to a lot more) when you buy everything seperately. So, to me, just buying a big set to begin with made sense: even if you don't use all of the knives that much, you've got that cool carving knife for the one or 2 times a year you'll use it. But if you had to pick only one knife, probably the 8"" chefs knife would be ""it"".    "
1940,kitchen_houseware,"This would be the one. THe 8 chef's knife was my first Wusthof; and using it for the first time instantly erased any remorse I had about the price. It is an incredibly fine precision tool for chopping, dicing, etc. I cook a lot for fun; and since buying this knife, I have pretty much upgraded every piece of cutlery I use to Wusthof (and I use them all). Still, if I were only permitted to own one kitchen knife, this would be the one"
1941,kitchen_houseware,"I've had one of these knives since 1968! I've used it several times every week since buying it, have sharpened it many, many times on both a whetstone (with oil) and with a ChefsChoice. The tip is a little bent and worn, and there's a nick in the handle, but it still cuts like new. I would give up my three Cuisinart Food Processors before parting with this knife. It's an essential tool in my kitchen, and I expect to get another 30 years' use out of it"
1942,kitchen_houseware,"I use this teapot a couple of times a day at least for loose tea.  The small size makes it perfect for work and home.All of the pieces feel solid.  The stopper stays up when brewing and it holds tight when pushed down to stop the brewing.The only complaint I have is the plastic strainer.  It often shifts in the pot, causing a little tea to spill on the counter  at least 50% of the time I pour  the first cup, though I am  careful to underfill it according to the directions.Despite that apparent design flaw, I continue to use it daily and I have purchased it as a gift for family members.Edited to add:  The strainer has finally irritated me too much. I am still using the pot daily, because the size is perfect and it is well-made, but I use my own mesh strainer, which has more capacity and  smaller holes.   Now, I have no leaves in my tea, no matter how small the leaves are (like when I make a blend of green and mint tea), and I have no concern about the  tea continuing to brew even with the plunger depressed"
1943,kitchen_houseware,Makes some of the best tea I have ever tasted.  Great for one or two people
1944,kitchen_houseware,"My wife (who has been a tea lover for over 30 years) used a tea press for the first time at a Quetzal's restaraunt a few weeks before Valentine's Day and was blown away by the delicious improvement in flavor.  So, for Valentine's Day I gave her this press and a bag of Mother Earth's Organic Earl Grey loose tea (I mean, how many years can you give candy and flowers?).  She loved it and has been enjoying it every day since"
1945,kitchen_houseware,"Bodum has had this design for some time, and, the only fault most users seem to find is the 'dripping spout'.  Most teapots drip when overfilled, same with this one. If the pot is filled about only 3/4 , and you pour slowly, you will find the chances for dripping are minimal.  The pot is surprisingly good at keeping the tea warm, and, it provides stimulation for visual senses as well. "
1946,kitchen_houseware,"I love this teapot - a co-worker had one and highly recommended it, so I got one and have to agree with her that it is a fantastic little teapot.  I like to brew loose tea - its usually better quality, less expensive, and has a certain appeal about it.  What's great about this system is that the interior tea canister has hole only on the upper 2/3rds of the cylinder so that when you press down on the plunger after its brewed, the leaves no longer steep and so the 2nd cup of tea in the little pot does not get stronger or more bitter while you are drinking the first cup.  It's wonderful to have this system at work - would also be good for home"
1947,kitchen_houseware,Normally I love Bodum products but this one is a loser.  The loose leaf tea gets stuck in the holes of the infuser and is nearly impossible to get out.  Add to that a terrible spout and a plunger that drops when it should be up (while brewing) and goes up when it should be down (while pouring).  But wait there is more!  This is my second press.  The lips on the plastic infuser and parts of the plastic lid have broken on both pots.  Replacement parts are available but cost almost as much as a new pot when you count shipping costs. The parts just couldn't stand up to daily use.
1948,kitchen_houseware,Easy to clean. My only complaint is that the holes on the strainer are a bit large for some teas...but I don't mind a few leaves in my cup. I have not had any problems with it dribbling or the plunger sticking
1949,kitchen_houseware,"I love loose-leaf tea, so this little teapot seemed like the perfect item for me.  And it would be, if the geniuses who designed it had any idea of how to correctly design a teapot.To start with the nitpicky complaints: First off, the plunger doesn't stay up very well, so unless you actually hold it up or leave it off altogether, the tea will stop brewing as the plunger sinks to the bottom of the chamber.  Secondly (and as others have noted), there is nothing holding the plunger in, so you have to hold it on yourself when you pour your tea.I could live with these two problems, as they're admittedly a bit nitpicky.  But the biggest problem is that the spout is very small and somewhat rounded, so any time you pour the tea when the pot is more than half full, a significant amount dribbles down the side of the pot instead of into your cup.  And I'm not talking about a few drops--we're talking 65% goes into your cup, and the other 35% ends up on the table or worse, in your lap.  I'd really like to know who the tester was at Bodum who thought, ""Hmmmm, a significant amount of near-boiling liquid is running down the side of the pot and landing on whatever is beneath.  Nah, that's not a problem.""  Hello, McFly??  Anybody home??  If you hear about Bodum getting sued because somebody wound up with a lapful of hot tea, well, you heard it here first.So go ahead and buy it if you want, but take my advice--be sure to hold the pot over the sink when you pour that first cup"
1950,kitchen_houseware,"I 'm writing this review the day after Xmas 2005.  We wrote on a family pollyanna we wanted a ""whistling tea kettle"".   A relative gave us this.  I just used  it to make my  favorite tea- Barrys Irish.  The person who wrote the last review was right-  it DOESN'T whistle!  Also the lid doesn't go down after you press the lever.  I had to manual squash it down.   I followed the directions- I mean this isn't rocket science.  The whole point is to get a sound so I know the water is boiling.   I am going to be donating this to the thrift store  and buying another brand that DOES work.  We previously had a Revereware kettle that worked until the whistle part fell out and down a black hole in the stove.   I am sad because this clearly is a defective  product and should not be  sold as a whistling kettle.  I wish they had a no star option on this review.  I let  it pass for one star because I liked the chartreuse  green color"
1951,kitchen_houseware,i love the shape and the color....unfortunately my son boiled water one night for probably one hour before we figured out that the whistler did'nt work!!!  this was the first time it was used....so what to do????i can handle the whistle not working only because i love the shape and color and i'm dreading the post office line to return the item...this is so cute!....maybe i should have purchased the le creuset kettle for about 40.00...it was red too!!!i think red is so hot! if you have to have a whistler.....here's hoping you will get one that whistles away your first use!
1952,kitchen_houseware,"This set is awesome and I work at at a retail chain that sells it.Our customers love the set. The tools are sturdy which is the best part!!!Im really poor so I cant afford the set,but everyone says it is just great"
1953,kitchen_houseware,"After watching my mother use her All-Clad tool set over the last two years, and seeing how well it has held up, I decided to go ahead and purchase this item.  I have not been disappointed, the quality is amazing.  The tools have a very solid feel to them, yet they are balanced and not too heavy.  They clean SO easily, and are even dishwasher safe.  We are throwing away all of our old tools and replacing them with All-Clad - it's amazing!  Amazon's price can't be beat.... I know for a fact that my Mom paid full retail through a very well known catalog (ending in Sonoma).  Amazon's price was half of that.  If you are contemplating this set, DO IT!  You won't regret it"
1954,kitchen_houseware,"These are the best utensils.  The tools and the crock are excellent quality 18/10 stainless steel, and very easy to clean.  The polished stainless is so gorgeous you can definitely use them to serve as well.  The handles match the handles of the All Clad cookware line.  They are an excellent design and quality that will last a lifetime.  An All Clad must have! Highly recommended! A"
1955,kitchen_houseware,"My mother-in-law was just commenting this weekend how cool she thought my All Clad utensils are.  I think they are not only cool looking but they also work great.  I have the All Clad pots and pans as well.  If you want to look like a professional chef and have some useful utensils, I'd suggest this set"
1956,kitchen_houseware,"The All-Clad 6-piece Stainless steel tool set costs more but it is worth it in terms of functionality and general apperance. In fact, we leave the tools and the companion stainless holder on the back of our stove top ...it keeps them close by for easy access and they look very attractive. The downside ... you'll like them so much that next time you will be reluctant to settle for a substitute ...if you want cheap stay away from All-Clad, if you want value All-Clad is the choice .."
1957,kitchen_houseware,"I can find nothing to take to task on the All-Clad tools.  I have nearly all the tools they make and I like them all.  They are easy to clean, no nooks for stuff to get stuck.  They fit well in the hand and have a substantial, but not heavy, feel to them.  Their shape is very good for the task at hand.  The sole negative is their price but when balanced against the good, including the fact that they should last longer than the cook, they are a bargain at the price"
1958,kitchen_houseware,"I've had this comforter for 2+ years now, and we use it year round.  The two snap-together layers make it versatile for using all seasons.  Plus, because the layers un-snap, it's easier to launder because it's not as bulky.  I was concerned that the layers might unsnap during use, but that hasn't been the case at all. The baffle box construction keeps the down from shifting around too much, and it stays fluffy day after day.  An occasional shake to increase the loft is necessary, but I've found that to be the case with all down comforters.  I use the king size comforter for our queen size bed, because we like the extra coverage on the bed.  One concern I've had with king size comforters is that they are plenty WIDE enough, but not long enough.  This one is long enough to tuck into the foot of the bed if we want to, and still comes up high enough to cover our shoulders when we sleep.  A GREAT comforter, and for the price, you can't beat it.  Truly three comforters in one"
1959,kitchen_houseware,"We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years.  They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.  I have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below, but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together, not just by the handle.  Fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand.  (They are made like hotel china, essentially.  Homer Laughlin is a hotel china company, in fact.  The first set of dishes I had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line.)For a bigger cup for cafe au lait style, I can recommend the Fiestaware ""jumbo cups.""  We have a set of those in Sea Mist and use them for coffee, but also for heating soup in the microwave.  They are both great.  Never been disappointed with Fiestaware"
1960,kitchen_houseware,"I hesitated to use these mugs when I first received them.  Now I use them exclusively as our everyday mugs.  They are a nice heavy weight ceramic that helps keep our coffee warm, they do not chip and wear beautifully.   I and my husband do not have a problem with the size of the ring to hold our mug as the other reviewer did.  I would have given them five stars if they held more coffee as I prefer a big mug.   These are simple and elegant in their design as all the fiestaware pieces are.  You can't go wrong with these if you are a fiesta fan"

1962,kitchen_houseware,The best way to bake a pizza is with a stone. They are great at distributing heat and make a nice evenly crispy crust. This stone is also easy to clean
1963,kitchen_houseware,"Re: another review saying that this is inferior to a Pampered Chef stone, I'm quite certain that the Pampered Chef stone is no different than this one; they, apparently, simply say that you can cook meat on it (don't know why you would, though). I've had several stones, and the only difference I've noticed is some break more easily than others. Not enough reviewers with long experience with this one to judge that, but I'm sure it performs as well as any other one.As for the dough sticking, I've baked probably 300+ pizzas on various stones. If they stick, it's because the sauce was too liquidy, and soaked through the dough. This happens sometimes when I do an olive oil, mushroom and chicken pizza, which is very liquidy. Not the stone's fault. And of course it will stick worse when it's not pre-heated! Why would you do that?! I'm guessing that the dough/sauce was more moist on this stone than the Pampered Chef one"
1964,kitchen_houseware,"I read all the reviews on the Pizzza Stone, some good some bad.I almost changed my mine and didn't buy it, that would have been a mistake.I received in in good shape, packed very well.If the pizza sticks to the stone, it's your fault not the stones. Like anything else it take a little practice to get it right, so don't expect a perfect pie the first time. I could see an improvment the first time I used it, by the forth try,I had it down to almost perfect."
1965,kitchen_houseware,"I bought two of these, despite their relatively high price.  I wanted to be able to cook two large pizzas at once for entertaining, so nobody waits slobbering while others eat their pizza.I've made pizza twice and have not been disappointed.  The stones are fairly soft and would scratch easily with sharp steel implements, so I'd avoid using them.  The sone's porosity means it will stain easily.  Spilled tomato sauce and cheese will bake right into the surface.  I expect my pizza stones will quickly develop a patina.  If you want clean looking pizza stones, the maintenance would be nearly impossible.  Otherwise, maintenance is easy.  Wash in hot water (no soap) and air dry.  Use a belt sander or orbital sander if you ever want to renew the surface.I'm surprised another reviewer received a broken pizza stone.  The manufacturer packages these heavy and moderately fragile items very well with lots of corrugated cardboard.  Both of mine arrived in perfect condition.  They were shipped separately, like apparently everything from Amazon.The crust is much better than the pizzas I was making in glass pie plates.  It's crispy on the bottom and tender in the middle.  The toppings are better too, because they are cooked at higher temperatures and have more of a roasted flavor.  Before, pizzas cooked at 350 F for 25 minutes.  The crust had good flavor but tended to steam under the vegetables and cooked very slowly.  Now, I cook pizzas in ten minutes (!) and the crust and toppings are perfect.  For entertaining, you could easily bake a pizza in the time it takes to assemble the toppings for the next pizza.I just received the peel.  For the uninitiated, a peel is the flat wooden pizza assembly station used to transfer the pizza to the stone in the oven.  So far, I have made four pizzas without the peel and it's frustrating, and possibly dangerous working in a 500 F oven.  Get the peel.  It's not an option.A tablespoon of corn meal on the peel and the stone will prevent the dough / crust from sticking.The pizza stone is requiring a new learning curve, and I'm fairly sure it'll end up being a bit more effort than the pie plates I was using, but the much better pizza will be well worth the little extra effort.  The peel and stone make it possible to have gourmet restaurant pizza at home.  It's much easier than most people would think, and much less expensive than eating out.  With no prior experience, expect 4-5 attempts to work out the tricks.  After that, homemade pizza is fast and easy.Pizza Dough:1 1/8 cups of warm water1 tablespoon sugar1 tablespoon dry yeast1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon olive oil3 cups bread flourCombine all ingredients in a mixing bowl in the order listed.  Mix by hand until liquid is absorbed.  Use a heavy duty mixer (Kitchenaid, etc.) and a dough hook to knead the dough for ten minutes (highly recommended), or knead by hand on a floured bread board until the dough has a silky sheen (the labor intensive method).  Spray with olive oil in the mixing bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise until doubled in size.  This takes 20-30 minutes in a 200 F oven (lowest setting) or on the stove top as the oven below is preheating.  Makes two 14"" pizza crusts"
1966,kitchen_houseware,"I wish that I had been able to use this product, but it arrived in three pieces.  There was no apparent trauma to the box in which it was shipped.  Buyer beware--a pizza stone is hard to ship without breaking"
1967,kitchen_houseware,"THEY WORK FAIRLY WELL.  I WOULD PREFER GLASS INSTEAD OF ALUMINUM, BUT THEY WORK OK.  YOUR SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT AND DELIVERY WAS ON TIME.  THANK YOU.JOHN VALENTIN"
1968,kitchen_houseware,"There are two of us who use this coffeemaker.  The coffee is very hot initially...but keeping the coffee hot on the ""warmer"" is not an issue as we finish it rapidly. The coffee is good flavor and we are fairly well satisfied.However...it is impossible to tell how much coffee is in the carafe unless you take off the cover and take a peek (who is up to that the first thing in the morning?).  If there is coffee in the carafe and you start another pot...you are in for a spill all over your counter.Care must be taken when pouring the first cup...CAREFUL it could spill because of the  small removavable plastic cover on the pour spout of the carafe. When initially pouring water into the pot...a hole in the back at the maximum fill level will prevent over-filling...but, overfill with water and you have a spill.Over all...the coffee that is made is good and hot (but we drink it quickly...""after any spills are cleaned up"". Never the less...the above mentioned ""negatives"" are more an avoidable nuisance than they are a problem.  Would we purchase again?  Very likely as it is compact, seeming well constructed and the brewed coffee is very good. "
1969,kitchen_houseware,I love my Cuisinart 4 cup coffeemaker with stainless steel carafe.  I chose the red and it looks so sharp in my kitchen.  Makes wonderful coffee.  I always get compliments on how my coffee tastes so good.  I will get another one if this one ever wears out
1970,kitchen_houseware,"I purchased this coffeemaker because of the stainless steel carafe. The problem is when you pour coffee into a cup, it goes all over, I have to pour off the kitchen sink. No matter how slow or fast, it makes a mess. The second problem is when the coffee sits on the warmer, it starts to boil. This may be a problem with just this one. I would not purchase this item again"
1971,kitchen_houseware,I have too many complaints. First its slow. Second the spout is awful. I always have a mess and I never usually have this problem.Now the heating element is wearing off. Also if you take the carafe out while the coffee is running it doesnt seem to shut off. So I have to wait for 5 minutes to make 4 cups of coffee. Dont bother. Waste of money
1972,kitchen_houseware,"I searched through these reviews to find out if I was the only one who recoiled at the metallic taste. I see I wasn't. If you want coffee that tastes only like coffee, avoid this thing. Design flaw: Top is hard to open (at least on mine; snaps shut, requires two hands to release). Anyone know of an alternative 4-cup (actually, this is more like a 3-cup)"
1973,kitchen_houseware,"It is cute, but it spills and it's defective. The water spills while trying to fill the maker. The coffee spills when trying to fill the cup. The so-called plate warmer is more of a burner. It doesn't keep the coffee warm as much as it burns it if you don't use it in 15 minutes. But now, after only four months, it doesn't work at all. The automatic timer turns the machine off after 3 seconds and that's being generous. Don't buy it for yourself... Don't buy it as a gift...  "
1974,kitchen_houseware,"I love this little pot, the coffee is perfect every time and it makes just the right amount for one or two cups"
1975,kitchen_houseware,Exactly what I was looking for.  Works great for outdoor barbecues.  Sturdy and easy to clean.  Good price
1976,kitchen_houseware,"As I have come to expect from Calphalon products, this pan is amazing.  It heats evenly, and cooks very well.  Highly recommend buying Calphalon products over other cheaper cookware... Even if you have to buy them one at a time to handle the cost ;)"
1977,kitchen_houseware,this pan is excellent....I wish they made it a tad biigger so i could cook everthing in it..I love it buy it...really!
1978,kitchen_houseware,"I've only been using this pan for about 2 months.  But so far it's my favorite pan for stir-frying vegetables and meat.  I haven't done too many other things in this pan, but I fried onions and hash browns and scrambled eggs and those came out just fine.  I especially liked doing scrambed eggs - they didn't stick to the pan, so that I got to eat all of it (the eggs stick to other pans and by the time you are done, there is only 2/3 of an egg left to actually eat).It's really non-stick.  Anything comes off really easily.So far, I am loving it"
1979,kitchen_houseware,non stick ok. I would have liked it deeper but worth the money any way
1980,kitchen_houseware,"I've purchased a few of these pans over the years. While I generally prefer cookware from Calphalon's competitor (Company A), this pan is a terrific value.It does not retain or generate the heat necessary for proper stir-frying; however, it is general utility pan that I use frequently. The coating is relatively long lasting and the quality is suitable for commercial cooking. If purchased on sale, it's a tremendous value that all home cooks should leverage"
1981,kitchen_houseware,"this one is a must have, for a 2 people family, right size, elegant, and as alwayz, Calphalon has the best quality in cookwares, easy to clean. i highly recommand it"
1982,kitchen_houseware,"I decided to purchase this pan based on prior Calphalon experience and the reviews here. I am very pleased with it. I don't find it that heavy, but the extra thickness does spread the heat very evenly. I have mixed feelings in general about the nonstick surface, but this is an instance in which it performs well"
1983,kitchen_houseware,"As other reviewers have noted, this is good Calphalon equipment.  And so it is pretty heavy, which means that, though you will be tempted to try to flip the food, you must content yourself with traditional stir-fry methods.  A non-stick stir-fry approach demands a non-stick wok spoon, but I haven't found one, so I use a nylon/plastic serving spoon.  On the other hand, a non-stick stir-fry pan cleans up easily.  (I never give 5 stars."
1984,kitchen_houseware,"This pan is on its way to being my first choice for cooking. Here's why:- It's very thick and conductive, food is hard to burn when using a radiant or coil stove. Not all of us have gas stoves, yet!- The thickness keeps the heating even and steady, while electric stoves cycle on and off- The non-stick quality is amazing. It feels like the whole pan is one solid piece of nonstick metal. I don't have to fear using a wire whisk on the surface.- I have the wok of the same line, commercial nonstick, and it has some limitations because of its size. This pan can be used for toss-fry (OK, you need just a little bit of muscle but not as much as tossing a wok's contents)- Swing forward, everything flies up, snap and catch it all. You don't need that angled pan some other maker has been advertising, the wall curvature is perfectly designed for toss and catch. This keeps your ingredients more intact than stir-frying.- You shouldn't put it in the dishwasher, but cleaning up is very easy. Everything slides off easily and you're done.- Until now my preferred pans were the decent quality, but cheap, $2.99 Steka pans from IKEA (I have 8-9) and they still do a good job for small servings, and I don't care about putting them in a dishwasher. But this pan's big enough for dinner while you need two or three of the Stekas.- Sometimes Amazon has a great price on this pan. I highly recommend picking up one or two"
1985,kitchen_houseware,"I do quite a bit of stir frying and this is the best non-stick wok that I have owned (I've probably have owned 4 or 5).  I bought this on a whim last year because it was on sale and now I'm buying another as a gift for my mother.  This is a great wok because 1)  it is heavy gauge and heats evenly 2) the non-stick surface has actually withstood reasonably high heat for a year now without significant discoloration or damage.  This is probably its greatest strength since all my other woks have either warped or lost its ""non-stickiness"" because of the high heat needed for traditional stir fry. It's also great for sauces and reductions because of the shape, size, and non-stick surface.The downside is that it is small.  Perfect size for servings for 2 but not great for family sized portions. I'd also recommend buying a lid if you don't already have one"
1986,kitchen_houseware,"This is a great lid that seals the bowl with the attachments inside.  But I recently opened it up after not using it for awhile and I discovered everything covered in mildew.  I guess I put the attachments in the bowl with some moisture on them and since the lid creates a tight seal, I was greeted with mildew.  I would suggest leaving it slightly open or making sure that there is NO MOISTURE inside when you seal it.  Otherwise, this is a great way to seal everything up against dust and dirt while not in use"
1987,kitchen_houseware,I even checked with KitchenAid about which ones were correct for our mixer and they apparently gave us the wrong code.  I join everyone here - why can't they make standard bowl covers?  This is crazy
1988,kitchen_houseware,The bowl covers are a great idea unfortunately for me I have an Artisan mixer and these bowl covers do not fit.  According to KitchenAid Customer Service these are for a discontinued bowl the correct model number for the current 5qt bowl is KNBC. 
1989,kitchen_houseware,"I have a white Kitchenaid Heavy Duty 5 quart mixer with an extra bowl and attachments.  The covers fit exactly as designed, nice and secure.  These covers are extra convenient  when letting yeast rise.  They are very handy in covering your attachments keeping dust and other particles out during storage.  I  recently ordered a new Kitchenaid 6 quart Empire Red mixer that I am surely in process of ordering bowl covers for this fine machine, also"
1990,kitchen_houseware,"I got these as a wedding gift, because I put them on my Amazon registry. I didn't read the reviews, because who'd bother - it's Kitchenaid and it fits a 5-quart bowl? I just opened them today and found out they don't fit my mixer, and now I'm stuck with them. Hoping to pawn them off on my best friend since she has an older Kitchenaid. Grrrrrr. Crappy idea on Kitchenaid's part, crappy idea on Amazon's part for saying they fit ALL 5-quart bowls when they obviously do not"
1991,kitchen_houseware,"I asked for this item about 2 years ago for christmas, and I have been happy with it since. Not an expensive model, this Item has worked really well for me. I bake on average 2 loves per month, so I am not a heavy user of the machine. But, As a guy in the kitchen, this thing is simple. Works really well with the boxed mixes, just follow the directions on the box. I have started in the past few months making my own bread from scratch using the recipies supplied in the owner's manual, as well as from the small bonus book of recipies. This thing is simple. This machine is great for a casual user like me, and a good value as compared to some of the other models available. It also simple to use. If you have a family to bake for, maybe a more expensive model would be better, but I am hard pressed to think that this machine could not handle that as well. 5 stars in my book"
1992,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this a little over a year ago because of the rave reviews.  I will admit- it is a powerful steamer and I loved using it.  However, just over a year now it has completely stopped working.  I turn it on and the light comes on- but it never heats up or steams.  Over $200 is quite steep for an item if it will only last a year"
1993,kitchen_houseware,"I was quite cynical about buying another steamer since the smaller models I'd tried dripped water on my clothes and didn't remove wrinkles. I went for the top-of-the-line model after some research and, lo and behold, it actually removes wrinkles. Clothes don't look crisp and perfect as when they come back from the drycleaners, but steaming will let me save a fortune and save the cleaners for actual cleaning.The machine was easy to assemble, and the tank is easy to fill. The whole gadget has a pleasantly retro, basic setup, which is aesthetically clunky yet charming. It sturdiness is reassuring"
1994,kitchen_houseware,"I use the Jiffy steamer j-4000 for clothing in my store.  The clothes are all organic cotton, bamboo, hemp and hemp-silk blends.  It works great for everything except the hemp and silk blends.  For some reason, silk seems to be resistant to anything except an iron for getting the wrinkles out.  If you're using this product for anthing but silk - go for it.... it's great.  Just be careful, as it gets hot enough to cause burns if you don't move your hands quickly in tight places like pants legs."
1995,kitchen_houseware,"This is a great steamer. It was a little more money than I wanted to spend, however, over the long haul this will be worth it.  It takes a little while to heat up, but once it is done it works great.  I use it for my home based business and it is wonderful.  For longer garments like pants or 2X shirts, I wish the hanging pole was longer or could be raised.  Overall, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase"
1996,kitchen_houseware,"As an attorney with offices in two counties, I travel quite a bit and used to run up hefty dry cleaning bills because my suits would wrinkle.  The Jiffy has saved me some money and works fairly well on my wool suits and cotton shirts.It doesn't give a really crisp dry cleaned look to the shirts- not a pressed look, but it's good enough in a pinch to freshen up  a shirt that's been a little wrinkled by the closet.On wool suits, it's masterful.  It takes the wrinkles completely out and leaves you with a suit that's ready for court.  It takes me about 3 minutes to steam a completely wrinkled suit.I've also used it on my ties with success, though i've been warned that it may be bad for more delicate ties.The only downside is that it takes a while for the Jiffy to heat up- sometimes up to 10 minutes, so it's not really the solution if you're in a big hurry.  I'll turn it on before I get in the shower and will usually do a few garments at a time- it's pretty fast once it has heated up"
1997,kitchen_houseware,"I just got into nice clothing and a salesman at a clothing store in Boston said if you have the space for it, get the real thing - a comercial Jiffy steamer.  I took his advice and am very pleased with it.  Works very well and it steams up my 510 square foot condo well enough to activate my fire alarm in about 20min"
1998,kitchen_houseware,"I bought this steamer to replace my much hated iron.  I have to iron uniform shirts, tee shirts and khaki pants every morning.  I found the steamer to be much less effective on those items than an iron and more time consuming.  I am terribly disappointed because I very much wanted to throw my iron away.  Instead I am exchanging my steamer for a new iron. "
1999,kitchen_houseware,"If you have thought of buying a high quality garment steamer, this is the one to get.  There are a few things that aren't clear from the description that I thought I'd share.  First, the reservoir can hold more than a gallon of water, and I wasn't sure how long it would take to be ""ready"" to steam - well, if you fill the reservoir completely, it takes about 15 minutes to heat up the water to be ready.  The steam is HOT and continuously pumps out of the steamhead, until you turn the machine off, or on standby.  And the reservoir holds enough water to continuously steam for about 2 hours.  Don't think that you will be able to steam up your clothes each morning before you go to work, because of the impracticality of heating up the water for 15 minutes first (I suppose you could, but that wouldn't be a very environmentally-friendly usage of this great tool).   What I did this weekend was spent about 45 minutes steaming just about everything in my closet that had the slightest wrinkle to it.   I think this is the first time in my life I don't have anything in my closet that is wrinkled!  This machine is going to save me a ton in dry cleaning bills because about half the time, my dry-clean-only clothes aren't exactly dirty, just wrinkled.   But the steam also removes odors - I noticed this when I was steaming my draperies - the steam released a dusty/musty smell from the drapes while I was steaming them.   Anyway, bottom line, this is a good buy.  Easy to assemble and definitely a quality work horse.   One down side is that it does have a rather large ""footprint"" so you will need a little space in your closet or laundry room to keep it handy and ready to rock.    Good luck and enjoy!"
