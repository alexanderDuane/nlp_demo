My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to\"},\n",

He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  \"Child of God\" is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.

I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.

       "  'text': \"The Protector's War (2005) is the second Alternate History novel in the Change series, following Dies the Fire.  In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.In this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.When the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.Nigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.At Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.Lord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.In McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.This story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.BTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?Highly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.-Arthur W.

Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I\\'ve ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.

       "  'text': 'I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like \"what just happened!\". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.There seem to be no faults in the utopian \"good guys\" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don\\'t know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional \"Clans\". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented.

In fact, if it weren\\'t for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I\\'d have given this book two, maybe three stars.  Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here.  Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism/Islam in Africa, Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism/Shintoism/Anamism in Asia, etc.  But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the \"Lord and Lady\" actually interact with some of the characters.  Yet the characters don\\'t sit there and think to themselves, \"Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!\"  Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind.  Oh, well.  My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum.  We don\\'t mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I\\'m personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let\\'s try to keep to a minimum the \"blessed be\\'s\" or \"lord and lady\" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay'},\n",

Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.His scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.Taylor\\'s macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.As the first book in the \"Penguin History of the United States,\" Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America\\'s colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come'},\n",

Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans.\"},\n",

This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films.  In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists.  In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party.  This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist.  And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings.But this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as right-wing Republicans.  While I am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left, I find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias.  The significance of this book to me from reading Ring Lardner\\'s famous \"I\\'d Hate Myself in the Morning\" to watching Woody Allen\\'s \"The Front\" and FINALLY getting a closing answer is overwhelming.  I no longer feel the need to explore why Americans chose to follow another government\\'s agenda to the potential detriment of our country.

In closing, I must comment on the complete disrespect shown to Elia Kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when Nick Nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award.

       "  'text': 'While George Clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his \"community\" are proudly out of touch with mainstream America, I was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by Ronald and Allis Radosh. For readers with an interest in the context of the culture-clash between the \"Hollywood elite\" and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and DVDs, this book is an excellent resource.I say the \"context\" of the clash because this is a look at history, and a serious research work too. This is not a book that details the fashionable Leftist obsessions of Clooney, Streisand, Penn, and the rest, and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly. Instead, \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" digs deep into something far more serious and sinister (\"sinister\" comes from the Latin word for \"left,\" by the way): the film colony\\'s infiltration by agents of the Comintern, dedicated partisans of Stalin, and other actors, directors, writers, and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the United States.As Clooney\\'s speech -- and even more so, his movie -- make clear, modern Hollywood\\'s sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against \"McCarthyism\" and the blacklist (that\\'s what makes Clooney\\'s self-congratulation so laughable -- does anyone in Hollywood *defend* McCarthy?). But the Radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence (in other words, the witch-hunt turned up real witches), but that there was also a strong and active anti-communist Left in Hollywood. Even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in Hollywood, it was this anti-communist Left that was in the most direct conflict with the Stalinists, their apologists, and their dupes, particularly before and during World War II.All of this is important information, but it\\'s when they turn to their discussion of HUAC and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront Hollywood\\'s defining myth. Far from the usual pop-psychology analysis of the deranged and sweaty McCarthy (and why do so few people seem to notice that *Senator* Joe McCarthy had nothing to do with the *House* Committee on Un-American Activities?) the authors have gone in-depth in committee records, and also into the backgrounds of the people from Hollywood who came before the committee. It\\'s certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of McCarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents. Ronald and Allis Radosh are to be commended for doing the latter.It\\'s because this book is so heavily researched -- so filled with names, dates, and places -- that I note again that it may not be to everyone\\'s taste. It is, I repeat, a work of history. It notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of, say, an Ann Coulter book, and so doesn\\'t have the fist-pumping, take-that-you-commie excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works.

That\\'s because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won\\'t hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh\\'s \"Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony\\'s Long Romance with the Left.\"Talk about exploding myths! Radosh\\'s book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true \"United Frontism\" and \"Popular Front\" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party\\'s propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed \"revisionist\" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like \"Mission to Moscow,\" \"The Spanish Earth,\" and \"The North Star.\" Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.I enjoyed Radosh\\'s book, the first one of his I\\'ve had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they\\'re talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz\\'s forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you\\'re not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn\\'t have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another \"we were innocent\" propaganda piece.'},\n",

This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it.  It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated.  It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation.  I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful.  The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions.    Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union.  It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union.  Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors.    Finally, the Radoshes put the \"Hollywood Ten\" and the blacklist years in perspective.  They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated.   I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost.  It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed.

Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin\\'s \"Red Terror,\" the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin\\'s purges of the late 30\\'s, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on \"McCarthyism\" and the ghastly \"blacklist.\" They\\'re listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you\\'d think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don\\'t believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that\\'s no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over \"McCarthyism,\" the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn\\'t have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps!The Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30\\'s and 40\\'s was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin\\'s mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin\\'s secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin\\'s killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the \"horrors\" of \"McCarthyism.\"While no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao\\'s Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her \"hero\" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see \"Mao: The Unknown Story\" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood \"useful idiots\" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet\\'s crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of \"The Motorcycle Diaries,\" a saintly portrayal of Castro\\'s chief executioner Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of \"counter-revolutionaries\" at La Cabana prison, something that\\'s highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro.The negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can\\'t refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts. Hollywood was filled with Stalin-worshipping Reds (now Castro-worshipping Pinkos), the Rosenberg\\'s were guilty as charged and Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy.

       "  'text': 'The McCarthy era is generally portrayed as one of the darkest times in American history, and those who faced blacklisting in Hollywood have been lauded as heroes. Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party.The Radoshes describe the infatuation of \"the Hollywood Party\" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union.  They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the \"Hollywood Ten\" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the \"Ten\" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work.  The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, \"Mission to Moscow.\" This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin\\'s purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed.  Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either \"named names\" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names.  For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration.If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony\\'s long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book.  In the meantime, \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" is well worth reading.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The back lash continues against the media strangle-hold on revisionist history.How many times have you watched a documentary or a movie that exhonerates those poor persecuted innocents, dubbed the Hollywood Ten, as sitting targets seated before an array of mean and ruthless right-wing zealots - the HUAC committee of the late 1940\\'s and early 50\\'s?  Over and over and over it seems, doesn\\'t it?  Well now we have a detailed and painstakingly written rejoinder, \"Red Star Over Hollywood\", which tells the real tale; that these were mostly hard core members of the communist party USA, who took their marching orders directly from the Kremlin.  They were Stalin\\'s men and, not to put to fine a point on it, useful idiots in his quest to foment a world-wide communist revolution.Ron Radosh, a communist from childhood, smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the Rosenberg\\'s only to find that .... they were guilty!  After he said so he was unceremoniously drummed out of the \"leftist corp\" and made to wear a political scarlet letter by his former comrades....some friends they.Radosh is a PhD in History and a diligent, detailed researcher of the facts i.e. he\\'s interested in the truth and in that sense wherever the facts lead him he will go.  Unfortunately, one doesn\\'t find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians, archeologists, political scientists, reporters, book publishers or video media types.  As an aside, I found it interesting to compare this book with Neil gabler\\'s, \"An Empire of Their Own: How the Jew\\'s Invented Hollywood.\"  The nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a world-wide communistic revolution?  Is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism?  I don\\'t know, but I for one would encourage Radosh to address the subject.  And, he\\'s the man to do it (another book to read as a companion peace would be \"Intellectuals\" by Paul Johnson, the author of \"Modern Times.\")It\\'s important to recognize that not all of those in Hollywood, whose lives were ruined by HUAC, were hard-core communists.  Some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices.  To the readers benefit, Radosh teases out these nuances rather well, and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest.Setting the record straight is important, but the Hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a \"fable of innocence destroyed by malice.\"  It\\'s their shakey attempt at moral authority, the kind that underpins a Sean Penn in his critique of Bush\\'s Iraq policy, while he ignores the evils of Sadaam Hussein.This book challenges the template of the Hollywood left: that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against right-wing bullies leading a witch hunt against \"un-American activities;\" that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers.  Read it, it\\'s good.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Actually, you can\\'t according to Greg Palast who challenges the results of the 2000 election in which he charges Jeb Bush with instituting his own style of Jim Crow laws to ensure that his brother would get elected. It\\'s unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that Bush would have won anyway. Palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up. But Palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote, and the votes that were not counted.He charges that more than 57,000 law-abiding citizens were improperly labeled as felons, and were kept from voting in Florida. These were almost all African-American who universally vote Democrat. There was an 80% criteria for finding a match of felon names. The company Choice Point started with a 90% match, but the state told them that was too high! They were told to make it an 80% match.So, a felon named John Johnson Jr. would also keep a law-abiding citizen named Jack Johnson or John O. Johnson from voting too. When did the state of Florida inform these people that they were on a felons list and could not vote? They didn\\'t, even though they were supposed to give ample notice to allow any mistake to be corrected.The company that got the job of putting the fix in, Choice Point was awarded a multi-million dollar contract over other companies that would have done the same job better for literally pennnies per voter. Florida decided to pay much more per voter with Choice Point.Now here\\'s the lie. Choice Point said that they did not use race as a criterion, but it was used as a matching criterion. Presto! Even with the disproportionate number of Blacks in the prison population, Palasts states that the number kept from voting was statistically way out of proportion to the number of felons.Just to ensure the outcome, the voting machines in Black neighborhoods were fewer and older than the ones in White neighborhoods. In some cases 18% of the Black vote was thrown out for one reason or another while in White neighborhoods were 1 to 2% was the norm. This was the perfect scam since anyone knows that Blacks would overwhelmingly vote for Gore, and the Whites would have had a large voting block for Bush.Florida\\'s official reason was that the law prohibited felons from voting. They didn\\'t want any felons to try to vote. (?)Palast asks, what felon wants to vote so badly that he would risk going back to jail for it? Good point! Not one person in Florida was arrested for voting twice.Then, there were the roving republican goon squads who went to wherever the recount was attempted to intimidate the recount process.Palast accuses the press of doing nothing or investigating nothing about a national election that was obviously rigged. When he offered the story to CBS, a network that has long since cowed to conservative screams of bias, they refused. Why? The CBS executive called the state of Florida to verify the story. They, the state, assured them there was nothing to it? Isn\\'t that like asking the fox if he can be trusted to protect the henhouse? Palast gained a large audience in Europe bringing this story to light. It received almost no attention here, and when it did, it was way after the election.This was the most important part of the book for me. While I enjoyed his commentary on Wackenhut and other exposes, this one was the most riveting. It scares me. This isn\\'t supposed to happen in the US. That is why I recommend this book and especially his newer one, \"Armed Madhouse.\"Palast proves by showing leaked documents, pictures and statistic improbability that this and the 2004 election were stolen by electronic ballot stuffing.

Then again, the mainstream media is owned by corporations that make money selling fluff and not upsetting too many of their readers, viewers, and/or listeners.  So why should we expect otherwise?Occasionally, Palast pushes the envelope on his ability to actually KNOW the motivations and responsibilities (blame) of various people he is writing about here.  More often than not, however, he simply puts forth so many facts, and connects so many dots for us, that it's difficult to not come to many of the same conclusions he has.  And, again, the actions of the Bush Administration -- and various members and associates of the Bush family -- have born out many of those conclusions over the past few years.Read this book and compare it with news stories from the past 5-to-6 years and, if you have done any digging at all, you will quickly see how scary the truth really can be.

In this book, Kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians, as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals.I believe most of David Kennedy\\'s interpretations and judgments are well reasoned. However, I disagree with his deemphasis upon the major decline in the stock market between late 1929 - 1931 as one of the main causes of the Great Depression.Even more so I dissent very strongly with David Kennedy\\'s suggestion the Roosevelt administration should have tried harder to avoid war with Japan by essentially appeasing Japanese aggression against China. To quote from his book, Kennedy writes on page 513: \"Why not acquiesce, however complainingly, in the Japanese action in China, reopen at least limited trade with Japan...\" Given the fact that Japanese aggression and atrocities in China were as bad or worse as Germany\\'s in Europe by late 1941, I find Kennedy\\'s opinion morally reprehensible.In general, this is a very good book, covering social, economic, political and military history of the era.

       "  'text': \"Freedom From Fear is an exhaustive study of America and its people during two of this country's most defining periods, the Great Depression and World War II. David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.This period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.The Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.The New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.The turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.The major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.This book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written. I've studied this period before, but I found this book very rewarding in that I also learned quite a bit I knew little or nothing about. I would highly recommend this book\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Despite the newfound popularity of social history, and ethnic history, and gender history, it's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice old-fashioned survey history of America. Heavy on political history, Freedom from Fear tells the story of America during the Great Depression and the Second World War. It is a survey, but it is broad and deep, running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years. David Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning text is worth every penny.Given the two broad subjects, it's not surprising that the book is essentially divided into two sections. In the first, Kennedy takes us on a journey into the downward spiral of the American economy during the Hoover years.  Maligned by history, Hoover could have been a better president than he was, but events overwhelmed him. Even his great success in life prior to winning the White House did not prepare him for the immensity of the task. Indeed, possibly no one could have handled it. But Roosevelt is seen here to have been up to the challenge. Not of actually fixing the problems. Kennedy is quite frank in his evaluation of Roosevelt's New Deal programs and his performance in such matters. In many places Roosevelt could have done better, perhaps by adopting a more internationalist approach to economics, or by not antagonizing and demoralizing the business community.More broadly, we see the decline in living conditions, and at the same time the rise of labor unions and government programs both useful and not. We see the uneven performance of the economy in various parts of the country, and the desperate mobility that sometimes resulted. We see a country scared and in turmoil, unsure of itself and its destiny.But though the Depression dragged on, waxing and waning, events elsewhere in the world did not stop to wait. Though America was among the hardest hit of countries, it was not the worst behaving on the international scene. Rumbles of war began in Europe and in Asia, and America stood aside hoping to avoid it all. Of course this was not to be, and with the Japanese attack America found itself thrust into total war. The economy was finally freed of the doldrums by massive war spending. The people were roused from stupor by the drumbeats of battle. Alliances solidified, and the enemies were targeted. And America joined the war in its own unique way. It could never be said that America takes no advantage of its industrial strength. While the countries of Europe dealt with the situation forced upon them, America armed itself and prepped for battle. It built its forces. It provided machinery and equipment to allies. It transformed factories to a war production mode. Industrial geniuses, pumped with cash, streamlined methods of mass production on a scale never imagined before. And newer and better weapons came to be. More than in most books, Kennedy makes it clear that the American effort in war was a mechanized and deliberate effort. When the Western front opened, it was run with industrial clarity of purpose.If there is a dominant theme in Freedom From Fear, it is that America runs on its commerce.  The business of America really is business. With or without government regulation, with or without organized labor, it is economy that runs Kennedy's America. But with such sweeping vision and engaging style, the reader could do much worse to learn about America in the interesting times than to read this gripping account\"},\n",

But where Hoover couldn\\'t make the ideological leap from good ideas that were to be voluntary only with only minimal government assistance, FDR was amenable to trying anything, including transformational ideas such as mandatory business compliance with Federal regulation, an evening-up of the playing field between business (which had corporatized) and labor (which until FDR hadn\\'t the power to do the same) and labor, to massive government spending. Although FDR didn\\'t understand Keyensian economics, he nevertheless proved the theory.FDR defined the \"general welfare\" clause of the Constitution, and left a legacy that has affected every single one of us ever since, and continues to do so today.Beside the in-depth look at the Great Depression, Kennedy also provides a survey of WWII, debunking many more myths along the way, and exposing the beginnings of the cold war in FDR  Churchill\\'s unkept promises to Stalin about the opening of a second front in Europe.I consider this a \"must read\" for anyone who considers him/herself interested in American History'},\n",

It explains some of the greatest crises of Western Civilization and parades in all their glory heroes like FDR, Churchill, Truman, and Marshall, and it singles out others for less glowing treatment.Professor Kennedy's survey of the period from 1929 to the end of W.W.II is, in my view, the finest of those perilous times. Naturally, the Great Depression and World War II are too vast for any one volume, and if one has an interest in any specific topic, personage, or chapter, the author has provided an unrivalled bibliography to kick off the quest.The professor's writing is simple and straightforward and he knows how to keep his narrative moving at a good clip. This is essential in such a lengthy document.

Professor Kennedy filled this book with lots of quality research, as well as his own opinions on the Great Depression. In the beginning of this book, Kennedy begins with Herbert Hoover and how he did things \"wrong\", but then he turned to FDR who kept up with the changing economy at that time. Kennedy portrays FDR as powerful and willing for change. He was an inspiring character for those during the Depression. Further into the book, Kennedy devotes his research to the New Deal and the effects it had on the Depression. Kennedy did go into detail about the effects, but he should have researched more about the causes of the Depression. Even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was Kennedy\\'s writing style that made the book hard to put down.

Management is not just business management, but is the ability to take advantage of opportunities in sectors of the economy that are likely to experience growth in the future, like education, the professions, and healthcare.2. Recognize that there is not one ideal way to organize an enterprise.  Both \"team\" organization and the \"CEO cult of personality\" have their shortcomings.  It can be difficult for teams to make decisions effectively and popular CEO\\'s must have successors.  You must find the right balance of organization that fits your company\\'s business needs.3. There is no one way to organize employees.  You need to lead workers rather than manage employees.  This is because management increasingly does not know the areas of expertise that employees possess, and employees are now seeking interesting and rewarding work.4. National boundaries and regional markets will become less defining factors of the companies boundaries.  Innovations in an industry don\\'t necessarily come from within the industry anymore.  Further, national governments will be less able to protect local industries from facing the competitiveness of the global industry leaders.  Global competitiveness must become a strategic goal for the business.Drucker also outlines the economic consequences of the declining birthrate in the developed countries.  A declining birthrate means that the working population will become progressively older.  New relationships must be forged with older workers, especially knowledge workers.  Companies that attract and retain knowledge workers past retirement age will gain a significant competitive advantage.Managers must become Change Leaders, who direct inevitable change in a controlled and orderly fashion.  Managers must look to extending the lifespan of their companies and approaching change as a source of business opportunity.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Peter Drucker, an editorial columnist for the Wall Street Journal, a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world\\'s most respected management thinkers. His books, over 20 of them, have been called the \"landmarks of the managerial profession\" by the Harvard Business Review.  He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought.  In 1954 he espoused the idea of \\'teams.\\'  In 1969 he proposed the \\'knowledge workers\\' concept.Here Drucker lays out six of the \\'new\\' challenges facing the businesses of the early 21st century.First involves management\\'s new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people.  There is no \\'one size fits all\\' approach.  The method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is \\'value.\\'  Employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers, \\'persuaded\\' rather than \\'ordered.\\'The next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape.  The collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for.  Global competitiveness is a must for survival.  Performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just short-term gains in order to inspire and commit \\'knowledge workers\\' to their mission.Third is becoming a change leader.  Educate others that change equals opportunity.  Regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results.  Enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company.  Study what is working or not in the market with other companies. Don\\'t confuse motion with action.Fourth are the information challenges.  The purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action.  Success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer.  Information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity, competence and allocation of scarce resources information.The fifth challenge lies in vitalizing \\'knowledge workers\\' into high productivity.  Attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow.  Differing from manual laborers, knowledge workers carry the \\'means of production\\' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work.The sixth challenge is managiing ourself (ourselves).  The biggest possible increase in production lies here.  Intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance.  Concentrate on your strengths.  Avoid trying to change yourself.  Ask yourself what your strengths are.  Determine how you work.  Do you like to work alone?  Would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker?  What are your values?  This type of questioning will help determine where you belong.  Most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once.  You must learn what makes \\'you\\' tick.Five Stars'},\n",

The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.

At the age of 89 (in 1999), Drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business. His chapter on \"Information Challenges,\" at 38 pages one of the longest in the book, Drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data. Few companies exemplify this better than Wal-Mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain.Perhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer, Drucker recognized that \"more and more people in the workforce - and most knowledge works - will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES.\" (Emphasis in original.) Drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives, something he himself did.As Drucker put it in his introduction, the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century. With this book, as with all of his others, Drucker may be gone physicially, but his thoughts will live on for many decades to come.Jerr'},\n",

To all these individuals, it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906.  This book covers that momentous year and much more as well.I had the good fortune of living in San Francisco for two years in the mid 1980s and experienced one relatively small earthquake.  These tremors from below are no laughing matter.  They are terrifying.  One can only guess at the magnitude of the quake of 1906.  Yet Californians are so blasï¿½.  Are they foolhardy or simply ignorant?  I think the former as no one could be unaware of the brittleness of the ground on which they tread.Simon Winchester\\'s book provides the reader with a brief history of plate tectonics, the precise events of 18 April 1906 as well as some ruminations about the future.  He puts this all in perspective and wonderfully entertains the reader along the way.  His analysis of Portola Valley as a \"deeply dangerous place (that is) liable to be destroyed at any moment\" is courageously and provocatively true.  I have visited this town many times and been simply amazed at how people can deny the very obvious fact that there lives rest upon a ticking time bomb.  No doubt his further view that \"many of its houses and offices deserve to be evacuated and abandoned\" will be ignored.  In the long run, he will inevitably be proved prescient.Winchester probably says much that people, particularly those who reside in California, don\\'t want to hear.  However, he is no crackpot.  Rather he is a writer who deserves to be read by a wider audience.  This book is a great work that I recommend to all....and that includes the residents of California.'},\n",

I learned about plate tectonics, the formation of the world, the settlement of the American West, earthquakes in the Midwest, and much more, but only 50-75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in San Francisco, and once the fire it put out, the book quickly ends.  There is a little discussion about the rebuilding, but mostly just to disparage the effort.  Winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of Latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling.

However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books \"Krakatoa\" and \"The Map That Changed The World\". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (\"From Plate to Shining Plate\"), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake\\'s history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America\\'s tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee\\'s books, most notably those comprising his \"Annals of the Former World\".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter\\'s personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter\\'s name. However, if you are interested in a sprawling, occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake, then \"A Crack in the Edge of the World\" may indeed be of interest to you, the potential customer and reader'},\n",

Indeed, the cover serves as a hint of things to come--folded into a cover is a surprisingly large poster--just as the ideas of this book are much larger than they first appear.If one truly wishes to understand the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the geological, sociological, historical and other effects that rippled outward in time from the central namesake event, one must prepare for a journey.  As with any great journey, some parts are better and more interesting than others--but the combined and lasting understanding of the science and history to be derived from reading this book is unequalled.  Suffice it to say that upon completion of \"Crack\" the reader understands earthquakes and their impact upon our world.Think of your favorite lecturer in college and you get a sense for Winchester\\'s style--a style wryly self-referenced as bloviation.  His diversions are often entirely unexpected (and not always entirely supportable) but enjoyable and thought-provoking nonetheless.  He communicates a sense of the joy of scholarship and discovery--being able to drive up to Alaska, for example, just to see how the big pipe fared in the massive Denali quake; being able to utterly discredit the worthless dreck rushed into print shortly after the disaster; pointing to that most Californian of attitudes--the stunning failure to take advantage of the opportunity to re-create San Francisco according to a grand master plan, a mistake echoed in Southern California\\'s loss of the redcars in favor of freeways.What Mr. Winchester desperately needs is a format that allows him more graphical content.

Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many.It's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions.

I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly.  I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks!I am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones.  Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.Randy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s.  He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.

To honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I reread Randy Shilts\\'s groundbreaking work, which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer\\' first surfaced at the CDC.It is still an intense and provocative book that reveals the social and political motives that became both pathways and obstacles for finding a cause and a cure for the killer disease. Shilts, who tested positive during the research for his book, but said he didn\\'t ask for the results until his writing was finished, nonetheless brings an emotional bias to his research. His regret (he engaged in many of the risky sexual practices against which he rails) runs like an electric current throughout and gives his story a kind of missionary momentum and zeal.As a result, \"And the Band Played On\" survives as a masterpiece of nonfiction storytelling because it is as much about a human disease as it is about the human condition including themes of betrayal and sacrifice, fear and love, exuberance and panic, loss and redemption - contrasts that the play \"Angels in America\" perfectly captured when it premiered in 1991.Shilts explored AIDS in America as a disease of both body and spirit - seemingly through the prism of his own tragic circumstances.

This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war.Author Randy Shilts tells the story of all-night all-day playgrounds on America's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses.  AIDS wasn't the gay plague, Shilts reports.  It was the 4th or 5th gay plague, nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of Stonewall's closet.  Gay sexual activists took it for granted, writes Shilts, that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases.  When the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early 1980s didn't magically appear, sexual athletes did what any normal hot-blooded Americans would do:  they blamed Reagan.Mr. Shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game.  His scorn for bath house behaviors  for blood banks is loud  clear; cheap-shotting of Reagan is muted.  Reagan, after all, had other wars and a rocky post-Carter economy on his hands.  By the time Mr. Shilts' book became a tv mini-movie, however, Reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain.  If only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name, thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved ... after all, we are now told, we all have AIDS.  (Ponder what Reagan might have said if he'd been convinced by Koop or somebody to speak the name of AIDS in 1982 or 1983:  Well, as your mothers probably should have told you ... Reagan, being a realist, understood that AIDS in America was/is overwhelmingly a behavioral disease.)Read And the Band Played On in tandem with Dragon Within the Gates by Stephen Joseph, former health commissioner of New York City and former Clintonista.

Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a \"gay disease.\" Gay men didn\\'t want to discuss that it \"might\" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable.

The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not.In between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years.Because the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain.  Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared.Rock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer!But even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind.The bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus.And, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death.Shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's.On the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity.\"},\n",

He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans.

He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears.While I agree that he can be classified as a conservative, I would also note that this is not a \"conservative\\'s conservative\" book.  By that I mean that people who are unabashedly Republican,  Religious Right, etc., will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history.  While Johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures, he does so on a case-by-case basis, always aiming to support his evaluations with fact.  In many instances, these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks.  They are not, however, smelling of the party line.Indeed, Johnson\\'s book is fascinating for his historical scholarship, research, and deep analysis.  His coverage of \"forgotten\" spans of time (i.e. Grant, Arthur, Hayes, Garfield) is welcome, as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage (i.e. Lincoln, JFK).  I found the 1860-1900 chapters to be personally most enlightening.Johnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life.

She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant.

       "  'text': 'Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like.  It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume\\'s take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950\\'s from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the \"Rifle-text\", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children\\'s sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the \"ages\" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad  twisted \"love story\" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah  Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author\\'s alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it\\'s almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, \"...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?\"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers  Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful  worthwhile), but here in the most \"modern\" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints  clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which \"voices\" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author\\'s own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to  for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann\\'s Seven Dreams series it\\'s best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn\\'t make sense at first will make sense later.Next up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt?  From what I understand this will be about the Hopi  Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970\\'s-1980\\'s.  Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip  The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century.  And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians.  Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can\\'t wait - Vollmann\\'s dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various \"Ages\" of our North American continent.'},\n",

New people, names,histories, and unique grammar reflective to  the period.

I didn\\'t find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me.

Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope\\'s one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are \"right-o, jolly-good\" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they\\'re just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with.

A unique difference from others in its genre is the \"Strengths Finder Profile\" (can be interfaced on the internet).  It covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits.  Chapter 4, page 83, does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four \"themes\" of leadership.If I may paraphrase Vince Lombardi (the legendary football coach): \"In practice I do not worry about what other teams are doing. If we concentrate on what we do best, the game will take care of itself.\" I found that philosophy to be the essence of this book.  Focus on your strengths instead of trying to change weaknesses.It is amazing how many companies make this mistake with their employees.  When trying to improve sales, and reduce turnover, they focus on the weakest link (the bottom) when more productivity can be realized by rewarding, emulating, and promoting the best producers.Those who have been obsessed with what is wrong in their lives will discover a better way is to learn what works best for themselves and others. The authors\\' ideas are motivational, inspirational and can be implemented by anyone.There are some revealing comparisons in the book to another prototype leader (Warren Buffett). Readers will be surprised and infinitely impressed with the key reasons for his success.This book should be a must read for anyone in a leadership position looking to improve the bottom line. It is very well done and has no comparison.  Reading it gave me strength, buy it and discover yours!Reginald V. Johnson, author, \"How To Be Happy, Successful And Rich\"'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen I was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor.This book is a great read and certainly we need to understand human nature and include it in our understanding of our history and ourselves today. McElvaine makes a good first stab at this and I will not repeat his argument again but point out a few important errors.The faults with the book concern the biology, both the factual errors and the lack of real exploration. The descriptions of the mating behavior of primates are not fully correct, especially regarding gorillas - the silverback has a very small penis and testicles and little interest in sex except when a female is ovulating which means at intervals of three to four years, hardly comparable to humans. McElvaine also says that animals rarely kill members of their own species but Dian Fossey stated that 25% of gorilla mortality was due to the male gorilla - he kills both other males and infants if he ousts a resident male.The biggest error is that apes are, in fact, not matrilineal. In chimpanzees and bonobos the males remain for life in their natal group and the females leave at puberty. This is most likely the case for hominids and humans ie human females have hardly ever been matilineal and had the benefit of this base for kin or female-female bonding.McElvaine makes a big case for human 'mounting' behavior which may be valid but amongst other primate species there is no universal evidence for it correlating directly with dominance and submission. Sometimes the dominant individual is mounted, sometimes females mount their female 'friends', sometimes a presentation is a way to give an olfactory signal by a dominant. Also, presentations that are submissive are very different from the upright, assertive, four-square stance of a female soliciting a copulation.These errors do not greatly undermine any of the arguments but do show that when we are going to use biology in an argument we need to know more than just a little biology. The fact that human males have nearly always spent their whole life with kin when females have had to join a new group to breed is an enormously important factor in the repression of human females and the dominance of men and masculine values - including men fighting over possession of such females. Looking at primate behavior tends to show that the roots of some of our behavior were very deep and strong well before agriculture came along.Also, even if we do think more about the male/female spectrum of human nature there may well be a number of males at the masculine end of the spectrum who are not striving to be anything other than they naturally are - ie are extreme males who simply have little or no capacity for feminine values. If these are the dangerous males then the best we can do is to stop allowing them and their virtual 100% masculinity to be the role models for the more average male - or even the average human.McElvaine's points about the false metaphors we use,  male-biased language and attitudes, misogyny, a male creator, the belittling of feminine values and behaviors and the impossible way men try to be 'notawoman' are certainly strong and in many ways obvious when pointed out. And it is surely foolish to think that such a lop-sided species can hope for anything other than toppling over in the mightiest of Falls.McElvaine offers a few ideas about how we might be able to overcome our maladaptive proclivities but it is an enormous task both to recognize our human errors and for men to ever overcome their maladaptive inheritance and genuinely not feel so much contempt for the feminine in human nature. It is hard to imagine the necessary changes coming any time soon.A highly recommended read and hopefully it will open up essential further explorations in this area\"},\n",

Don\\'t get me wrong: I have no problems in beeing a man, but I\\'m honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure, on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman, that he is not a sissy or a gay - wich is even worse -, but, on the contrary, that he is a real macho, a sex machine that can \"score\" as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence.

The bottle wielder is none other than US Congressman David Dilbeck, who heads the committee that keeps sugar prices artificially high and ensuring fat profits for corporate sugar farmers, who in turn pay their workers disgustingly low wages.   Dilbeck is recognized by one customer who is so infatuated with Erin he offers to blackmail the congressman into helping her get custody of her daughter, which she lost in the divorce because of the job she had to take in order to pay her attorney fees.  When the customer disappears, his body later found by Florida detective Al Garcia while on vacation in Montana, Garcia links the death to a missing attorney and his cousin, who happened to be the fiance of the man who was bludgeoned by Dilbeck with the champagne bottle.  At the same time, the bouncer at Erin\\'s strip club, the Eager Beaver, had been attempting to earn a huge settlement by planting a roach in a carton of yogurt.

       "  'text': 'To paraphrase from preface\\'s the famous Dr. Noam Chomsky\\'s (a personal hero) suggestion regarding our ignorance, we do not have any idea  how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved.  I have read this book the year it first came out (1997) and many times over since; should one still belive that thoughts, feelings, beliefs, meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood?  Dr. Pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we ,I mean any non-psychologist, take for granted every day.  I use my mind every day.  (My wife and co-workers might want to argue otherwise, but they are wrong!  I do think on a daily basis.).  Yet I don\\'t have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain.  Is the 17 th century French philiospher Rene Descart right when he proclaimed \"I think therefore I am?\"  What insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since Descart\\'s time?  Another words, do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind?  Dr. Pinker, now at Harvard and a gaint in this field, do not have the answers.  As a matter of fact, he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true.  However, he has painted an overall picture on the state-of-art research on cognition.  Oh, the book.  It has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried (I think and hope) to tickle readers\\' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs.  For example, under the standard equipment chapter, rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind.  He used the working definition of intlliegence (ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one\\'s action to reach that point) to illustrate that we use our desires (ie the latest big screen Sony TV) and use our beliefs (ie if I work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income) to increase the chance of achieving that result (i.e. watching the Final Four basketball games on SONY big screen TV).   Yet is this stimluli (vivid and beautiful live college hoops on TV) and response (working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income) due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input?  Do we endlessly shop for junks we cannot possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all?  Perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere knee-jerk response to stimuli.  What about the molecular/celluar level of the brain?  Can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work?  From page 99, Dr. Pinker stated from the mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts that neurons have one purpose in life: \"add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded.\"  Are you joking me?  With a description like this, it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron.  Suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level, as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness (my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks) that might be more important than any single cell.  Another words, perhaps thoghts, ideas, imagination, emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these \"supercomputer\" networking.  This conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless.  What about complexity itself?  Can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival?  It is beyond imagination of my limited mind (no pun intended) that perhaps I don\\'t have adequate brain power to understand my mind?  So why should I or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way?  A mental life is the result of my mind, and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases.  Why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space?  Is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings?  Why can I be peaceful and happy like I want to be every time I am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in Los Angeles?  Dr. Pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish.  He only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas.  I keep this book close to me at an arm\\'s reach every time my mind fails me (more frequent than I like now days and I am only 36 years old) and I re-read it over and over for its shear beauty, audacity, and clarity.

I was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author  his book. My decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick - over 600 pages -  the apparent level of complexity, judging from my random five-finger test.However my deep personal interest in understanding brain science  the curiosity streak in me finally drove me to buy the book.The first half was quite an easy ride for me as the author offered a general model to explain how  why the mind works the way it does. This is despite the fact that the writing was dry  monotonous in most areas, witty  crisp in some areas  cram packed with seemingly irrelevant information. The second half was a tough ride for me as the author touched on the implications of social behaviours.Frankly, I am not disappointed by the book even though I am still puzzled by some parts of the book. My own personal assessment of the book is that it is an intellectual smorgasbord of disparate, multi-disciplinary scientific topics/facts (e.g. natural selection, artificial intelligence, neural networks, economics, biology, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, family values, feminism, emotions, etc.) which probably make my reading somewhat difficult, especially towards the second half of the book.At the end, I have really enjoyed reading this book, particularly in terms of what I am looking for in the first place. I also like the author\\'s extensive notes and large reading lists.The most productive learning experience for me is a better understanding (may be I should say another perspective) of visual perception.

From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole.So the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and Family Values rather than the workings of the human mind, though these sections are also a very good read.Having read widely since, I know there is far more that needs to be understood. Particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women, like myself, who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male.Also, with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male.It is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species, though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male.Pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters, sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them, which naturally overrides female mate choice. He is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another.In this book Pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'The Blank Slate' when he writes about rape.Though I now know enough to be able to question points in this book, I still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.\"},\n",

       "  'text': '1. Discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you.`As A Man Thinketh\\' by James Allen encompasses the idea that \"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.\" James Allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that \"In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man\\'s weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own and not another man\\'s.\" Before reading the book I was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience. I have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to, though I was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create? After reading this book I felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective. I felt as though I had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life, slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture. A world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance I could begin to experiment to see just what exactly I can create. This same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress.Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.As each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent. \"Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.\" Mentally reviewing past experiences I can see and understand the correlation between thoughts I had chosen to entertain and my circumstances. Looking at my present situation I can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality I see before me. At an ever increasing pace I am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present, my future and my past. The more I practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way.Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to \"drift\" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.Reading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives. Through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody. If there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created.2. Can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships, your beliefs, your goals, your values, etc? Explain.Since reading As A Man Thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me, as I can, to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions. Embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society. I believe this would push us all in a more positive direction. I can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework, frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box. If our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking. If we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality, and even learn to positively influence reality, then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking. My goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision I see of a world that works for everybody into a reality.Reading `As a Man Thinketh\\' helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet, which is that there is no such thing as chance. Looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined. I do, however, think we co-create every situation in our lives through our thinking. Our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we don\\'t pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the `chance\\' concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience. Realizing I have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life. The idea to me makes life in my mind fair. At least for the experiences I can vouch for.When I read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and I had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences. About three years ago, just before I left England, I fell out with my best friend Huw who I had been friends with for ten years. One weekend in the summer of \\'02 after I had just come back from a holiday with Huw and some of our other friends. In the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place. The crux of the story is that Huw decided to take somebody else\\'s word over mine with regards to a then recent situation. The information Huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being. At first the situation seemed like a chance happening and I was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about, having arisen from decisions based on what I knew to be a fabrication. I felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary. I really didn\\'t understand how such a situation could have come about. Could it be that sometimes life was unfair? For days I was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts, searching for the cause of the situation. I started with thinking that the person who had lied to Huw was to blame and that Huw had had issues anyway. I came to various conclusions, however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over. This stirred more confusion in me as it was something I did not wish to believe. After really stepping out of the picture, leaving the country for Cambodia, which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life, and then thinking about my relationship with Huw retrospectively I came to see that just as \\'Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.\\' life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship. I asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant. If I had been a good enough friend to Huw then trust would have gone without question. I had lost the trust and faith of a friend. The deterioration of my relationship with Huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where I was forced to pay attention. The situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important. It wasn\\'t anything to do with one situation. I had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues I should have paid attention to, until finally it was right in my face and I had to pay attention.A man does not come to the alms-house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force. The criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity, its strength and weakness.3. What are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book? Please Explain.One of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances.After reading As a Man Thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it\\'s supposed to, indeed quite perfectly, and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules. James Allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way.If there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer? My understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer, it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow. It is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind, body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another. I believe we all have what I can at best describe as a magical force inside us. Ever seen starwars? I feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force, or whether it controls us. Where does cancer come from? I think we create it. I think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to... and through our neglect of certain areas of our life, that we cause such a thing as cancer, and indeed everything else, to manifest.We all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good, or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse. I think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness. I think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world - all the conflicts of the world, or the cancers of the world, so to speak. Take for example the conflict in Iraq or the Israeli situation, the problems in South Asia... I believe it\\'s all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us. We are in control... you, me... everybody. And we all have blood on our hands.Paul Sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become. There is no fixed human nature, no predestination, no God that determines our course. And we suffer because we cannot handle this burden.The power to think, feel, express, believe, will, do and progress is, from the start, all within our hands. This is an extremely dangerous distribution of power, and on some level we all know it. As a result, most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to off-load that responsibility.And we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity. Life in orthodoxy is comfortable, familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency. We sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment.The world around us is an extension of the world inside of us. When we do wrong, we are only doing it to ourselves. I think our whole world has got cancer... and it could even look as thought it\\'s dying, although I hope its getting better. If you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them, our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it.Thinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully. Ever since reading As A Man Thinketh I\\'ve been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality. I think As a Man Thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race. The more I think about it the more it makes sense.4. Has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way? If so, explain how?This book has entirely changed my thinking and now I look at life from a totally different standpoint, one where I can see how I am in complete control of my circumstances. Now when I look at seemingly problematic situations I ask myself why and how I have created the situation and I ask what can be learned from the situation. Reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended, I think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody. Why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened? If we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us, no matter what they are.I now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts I allow myself to entertain. Oftentimes I am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from, but now when I find myself thinking something less than constructive I stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling.He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it'},\n",

This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage.  The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong.  He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it.  If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn\\'t get to a judge.  They\\'d likely settle.  And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were \"traditionally drafted.\"  And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause.  That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople.  The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language.

       "  'text': '\"Tearing Down the Walls\" charts the ascent of Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill, from lowly brokerage clerk to master of a globe-straddling financial empire.  What emerges is a picture of a man who is fiercely ambitious and terrifyingly astute - but  also seriously flawed.Prone to fits of rage, Weill regularly unleashes streams of expletives on petrified subordinates, sometimes reducing them to tears.  He is quick to punish close lieutenants foolish enough to evince the slightest bit of disloyalty.  And his laser-like focus on cost-cutting tends to sow disaffection among employees.But he is also something of an enigma.  Despite his fearsome temper, he has a tremendous capacity for empathy, often moved to tears upon learning of the plight of others.  Shy and unassertive in his early days, he later metamorphoses into a self-assured and forceful leader.Langley is a skilled raconteur and her silken prose is a pleasure to read.  Her ability to glean the finer details of Weill\\'s life is also impressive.  Without a doubt, this is one of the best business books of the year'},\n",

       "  'text': \"The author could have done much more with her subject.  Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character.  For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive.  At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet.  Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly?  Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual.  But the author never treats him as such.In the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter's of Weill's life and career.  To sew the articles together into a coherent story, the author suggests that Weill's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the WASPy Wall Street powerbrokers who won't let a Jew join their club.  Perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven Weill for the past 40 years.  But it raises interesting questions that the author doesn't address.I'm a Jew in finance and Jews have been very well-represented on Wall Street for some time now.  Weill is presented as having been driven to create Citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the WASPy Wall Street club.  But by this point we're into the nineties and any exclusive WASPy club had long since been abolished.  So all of a sudden Weill comes off as pathologically insecure, which is intriguing.  But the author doesn't elaborate.This is a good book if you want a run down of Sandy Weill's career.  No other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place.  But all that information confirms that Weill himself is a very complex man; to do her complex subject justice, the author would have had to do much more with this book\"},\n",

Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.

However, since on most units, medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases, the sad fact is that meds are not looked up. My first PDA drug guide was Mosby's, which I have had for over a year; I now also own Davis's. I cannot tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages, adverse reactions, or nursing considerations. More than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result, but had I not been in the room, the med likely would have been given. How nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket, searchable by both generic and brand names (no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name), always accessible.So now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a PDA drug guide, but which one should you buy. Like I said, I have owned Mosby's Drug Guide for over a year and have just recently purchased Davis. I have found Davis's drug guide to be more thorough. Davis is also easier to navigate. Both Davis and Mosby have drop-down menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the med-entry (i.e. mechanism of action, adverse reactions/side effects, compatibility, nursing considerations, client education, etc); however since Davis has the content divided into more subsections, it is quicker to navigate to the desired content. So, my personal choice is Davis; however I do not think you would be remiss to purchase either of these. I only encourage you to move out of the hard-copy med-book and to the PDA version.You may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides (such as Pagana  Pagana's Diagnostic Laboratory Test Reference, ISBN 0323033954; or the one included in Medical-Surgical Nursing Clinical Companion, ISBN 0323031994), medical dictionaries (Like Taber's, ISBN 080361408X), and more.

What then is the affable Mr. Rancic doing offering advice on good and  ethical business practices?  Making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame, that's what.  In two hundred pages, he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215,000 applicants to become the Donald's first `Apprentice.'  The reader is privy to Mr. Rancic's early entrepreneurial efforts, businesses that whet his appetite for something larger.  Readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition.  Through it all, Rancic recounts the lessons he's learned, persons he's admired, falls from which he's risen.  He offers opinions on Kwame Jackson, his fellow runner-up to the Apprentice title, and `deceitful' Omarosa, whom many believed was the cause of Jackson's loss.  He also details lessons he's learned on goals, values, strategies, leadership, vision, and success.  While business school grads may scoff at Rancic's straight-shooting and simplistic advice, it is less idealistic than The One Minute Manager series of books.

This fortuitous mix of \"apple pie\" ingrediants have garnered him national fame, and this book outlines his experiences (along with the lessons he learnt along the way) that propelled him to be The Apprentice.The accounts of his experiences are modern day fables, with the moral of the story encapsulated as life lessons at the end of each chapter.

It is not very difficult to go online and read any number of Conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day.

I have frequently heard that Liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual. But, The Conservative Mind blows a hole through all of that. Kirk examines major Conservative thinkers like: Edmund Burke, John Adams, George Canning, Benjamin Disraeli, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, and T. S Eliot (amung many many others).The most difficult aspect of this book is to accept John Randolph and John Calhoun as figures to be celebrated. They both were men who used their talents to protect an evil system of slavery. Although, as another reviewer elquently noted, Kirk was not endnorsing slavery or racism or anything like that. Just the fact that Conservatism is a The \"negation of ideology,\" and that change will happen, in Kirk\\'s prospective Calhoun was only following that line of thinking. I personally don\\'t agree with it that far. As obviously slavery was antithesis of what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution stand for. But, again stating, Kirk is not writing to argue that slavery should not have been eliminated- only that change has to follow the methods of that society.I would recommend this to anyone- Conservative or Liberal. It is a magifnicent study of Conservativism. It can be a little dense at times, but that is to be expected and it shouldn\\'t detour anyone from reading it.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, \"[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man\".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, \"What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well\" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent\\' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities\\' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun\\'s support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation\\' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region\\'.Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, \"state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law\". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.The third thread would be Kirk\\'s anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny\\' and `impotent\\' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice\\', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved\\'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk\\'s salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day.'},\n",

But I do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer.  The caricature to which I refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change.  In fact, the reviewer even argued that the Soviet Union could have been seen as a \"conservative\" system (an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media).Perhaps the reviewer missed or didn\\'t understand Kirk\\'s repeated references to conservatism as the \"negation of ideology.\"  An ideologist is anyone who tries to rubber-stamp a system of premade ideas onto a society or culture.  Think of the \"New Soviet Man\" in the Soviet Union.  Think of the \"Cultural Revolution\" in China.  For that matter, although it wasn\\'t imposed militarily, think of the \"Great Society\" in America (it worked out about as well as the first two).The \"negation of ideology,\" then, is the conservative idea that one takes societies as one finds them, and then tries to work out change organically from within those societies, rather than imposing it on them from the top.  (Think of the current liberal infatuation with attempting to rule America through the Supreme Court for a good example of the \"imposing from the top\" model.)  Sometimes this change can be quite radical, radical in the sense of \"getting to the roots\" of something, as in the American Revolution (which Kirk discusses extensively).  The colonists believed that the liberty they already knew was being circumscribed, and fought to extend it.The reviewer also slanders Kirk in implying he would be in favor of accepting slavery.  No, our own Constitution details life and liberty for all, and the organic application of it (as we see in our subsequent history) extends that life and liberty to all.  Even the writers of the Constitution, some of whom owned slaves themselves, knew that the Constitution\\'s principles would lead to freedom for all.  Lincoln (a Republican, let\\'s never forget) certainly knew it.If you really want to know about the intellectual history of conservatism, this book is where to start.  Don\\'t be put off by reviewers whose lack of sympathy for the subject leads them as well to a lack of understanding of the subject.'},\n",

A liberal believes human beings are essentially good.  Modern \"liberalism,\" aka socialism, having failed to prove any of its theories as to where evil comes from, has turned cynical.

Is this a perfect book? No. Is the writing outstanding? Yes - but not completely perfected. Is the plot compelling? No - then The Historian and DaVinci Code are compelling but thats all they offer. What is it that makes this book worth 4 stars? It is simply DFWs ability to capture the irony and lassitude that characterized the youth zeitgeist of the late 20th century. He does this with humor and zest that are rarely matched. It may be DFWs lack of driving plot that makes people so frustrated. However, recall that the \"Greatest American Novel,\" Moby Dick was panned commercially and critically when first published. Was Melville ahead of the collective curve? Probably. Is DFW also ahead of the curve? Given the equal number of people who dislike or love his writing, it is not unlikely.

Cooper\\'s contention that John F.

Fellow \"fringe\" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.I\\'ll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper\\'s death were suspicious.

If you implement just a few of the ideas he puts forward, you will make considerable improvement in your life.Some of the more notable bits of wisdom:\"We learn nothing from telling.  But there is no limit to what we can learn by asking and listening.\"\"Others see in us what we see in ourselves.\"\"People who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people ...\"\"Before you start out, know where you want to go.\"The book contains a wealth of great information and wisdom.  However like any great advice, it is useless unless and until the reader takes action.  For the words to benefit you, you must take action.

In preparing to bet the Kentucky Derby and other races this year I read Andrew Beyer\\'s fantastic book \"Beyer on Speed\" and Joe Cardello\\'s book \"Speed to Spare\".  These two books fundamentally changed the way I handicap races. It is simply careless to handicap races without understanding Beyer Speed Ratings and use them to your advantage. This book explains the origins of the Beyer Speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work. I used the information on \"Beyer on Speed\" and \"Speed to Spare\" this year (March, 2005) to hit a big trifecta at Santa Anita - without Beyer Speed ratings and the information they provide, I would have never made the bet I made.Andrew Beyer is not only a great author, but he is at the forefront of making a day at the races enjoyable to all.  \"Beyer on Speed\" is a book that will absolutely make your trip to the track more enjoyable than you can imagine.  Beyer doesn\\'t sugar-coat the various elements that make handicapping a less-than-perfect science, but he does help you understand the fundamentals in a very concise way.I appreciate Andrew Beyer\\'s commitment to racing/handicapping that is so evident in this book and in all his other writings.

What makes reading Beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see, vividly, the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches, in the stories - one might call them lessons - he recounts (the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing).  Beyer, like Bill James, is a scientist, and thinks like one, to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides, and making the same old mistakes.

Sadly, I couldn\\'t have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn\\'t possibly be Danielle Steel\\'s \"Number One Bestseller\" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a \"bestseller\".The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad.

I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious.One of the topics discussed is called \"Mineral Rights\", a type of conversation designed to get deep, past the surface and into the truth of what is going on.  The approach accomplishes four purposes:  Interrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges, and enrich relationships.  It has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate America, and is rarer still where I work now.  The book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them.  The many questions posed throughout the book, and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace.   The answers usually are \"in the room\" if we can really get honest and start looking for them.In addition to some great business council, much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves.  Often we are the problem, and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie, is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships.  Another great approach used is the \"Decision Tree\" to help build empowerment in others.  Communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others.  (Page 252).  Her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool, both internally and in interactions with others, were right on.While this was all excellent, and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches, what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our \"emotional wake\".  We all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people.  The question is, what kind of wake do we want to leave?  How do we want people to feel?  This served as a great wake up call for me while reading.Overall, this book is so full of great wisdom and insights I couldn\\'t begin to do it justice here.   From the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout, I believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication I have read.

The October 16, 2006 appearance covered the issues of Mr. Ritter's current book Target Iran.  Transcripts and podcasts are available.It is Mr. Ritter's contention that the Busch administration's primary tool of foreign policy is that of regime change.  Any efforts by those nations that are so targeted to engage us in diplomacy have and will be rebuffed.  This administration will not talk to those it considers it's enemies.  This has been challenged in the media by the James Baker group, but it remains to be seen if they will effect any changes.Target Iran, according to Mr. Ritter, in based on press coverage in the Middle East and private confirmation of those stories by members of our intelligence community.  The story is that America is already working inside Iran with dissidents to identify targets.  We are also said to be negotiating the details of staging areas for our base of attack for this widening of the Middle East war.  Once that is completed, this administration intends to attack.The public is and will be sold the same scenario in which (ala Downing Street memo), the facts will be fixed around the policy.Why will this happen?  One element is the influence of Israel.  Iran is perceived, and not incorrectly, as a major threat to Israel.  But Ritter makes the point that Israeli and American interests are not identical.  After the recent events in Southern Lebanon, watching our congress and our administration give their complete support to whatever Israel was going to do, it's hard to see much separation.Whatever the threat to us from Iran, Mr. Ritter says it's very much overblown at this point and should not lead to war.  Iran, according to Ritter, approached this administration several years ago to normalize relations and limit it's nuclear research.  They were rebuffed.  Mr. Busch can only visualize regime change.If this goes forward as Mr. Hersh and Ritter both seem to think is inevitable, what are the chances of success?  According to these gentlemen, the results will be utter catastrophe.  Iran will immediately shut off the oil spigot.  Venezuela will create a hemispheric crisis by acting in sympathy and fail to honor their US contracts.  US troops in Iraq will be under attack by the Shia and possibly because of a religious fatwa in response to our attack.  Iranian missiles will be directed against the Saudi oil fields to further disrupt the world markets.  The world economy will be plunged into a massive recession.  This could lead to a ground invasion of US troops most likely from Uzbekistan that could easily turn into a trap.  Our ground troops are seriously depleted and under equipped at this point already.  Here is where Ritter says this administration could use field grade nuclear weapons to break the back of Iran.  He thinks this is the ultimate deal breaker because it absolutely assures us that radical Arabs will find a way over time to deliver a nuclear bomb to an American city.These scenarios seem outlandish, except there are so many radical Republican sources cheering on war with Iran, that one cannot expect this administration to not once again respond with a military solution as the first order of business.  Of course, they visualize success not the failure predicted by Ritter.The massive failure of our government during Katrina and the fiasco in Iraq are both symptoms of the same problems in the Busch administration.  What if war with Iran leads to the doomsday scenario that Ritter and Hersh talk about.  This book is a sober assessment of these issues and should be read widely by the public.The potential of a Democratic House of Representatives in the near future will not change the scenario described by Ritter.  American militarism is ascendant.  As Ritter says, if the war in Iraq were going well, the public would be very satisfied.  The fact that the war is against all tenets of international law and was an immoral act on our part is not something that most of us seem to worry about.  Too many Democrats only talk about running a competent war\"},\n",

This book is an excellent companion to learn the finer points of the practice at your own pace.This book is also phenomenal for those experienced in Ashtanga who want to create a Mysore practice.

Swenson\\'s book not only lets you look at one asana at a time, but it also provides an \"at-a-glance\" sequence for a kind of \"cliff notes\" effect.

       "  'text': 'Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know.Alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party.Every election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage.Alterman tells us that \"when it bleeds, it leads\". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on.'},\n",

He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not?I also picked up on Alterman\\'s assertion that the MSM\\'s inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley\\'s \"Firing Line\" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox\\'s Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative!Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists.'},\n",

       "  'text': '\"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.\"-Napoleon HillIf you asked me to recommend to you the single best book I have ever read, my answer would be a very definite \"Think and Grow Rich\".First published in 1937, this is the end product of two decades of research conducted by Napoleon Hill. His research started when Andrew Carnegie (the steel tycoon who was then the richest man on earth) gave him the assignment of organizing a Philosophy of Personal Achievement. Hill, who was a poor journalist, armed with just an introductory letter from Carnegie, set out to interview over five hundred successful people including Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman, William Wrigley Jr. and Charles M. Schwab. Hill then revealed the priceless wisdom of his research in the form of the thirteen steps to success (in Think and Grow Rich) and the seventeen principles of success (in courses and lectures he conducted).The concepts taught by Napoleon Hill transformed my life. Some of these include developing a definite purpose, building a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA), channeling the power of the sub-conscious mind and dealing with adversity. Everything he wrote about or talked about is thought provoking. He was wise, humble and funny. His philosophy is universal; he did not mix it with religion. The riches he referred to were more than money, for the Philosophy of Personal Achievement can be applied to anything in life.This is a classic, and hence the examples are old (not to be confused with outdated). But they are as relevant today as they were in the early twentieth century. Here is an example from T in the chapter on Desire:On the morning after the Great Fire of Chicago (1871), a group of merchants on Chicago\\'s State Street went into a conference to decide whether to rebuild their stores or leave Chicago. All but one decided to leave. The merchant who decided to stay pointed a finger to the remains of his store and said \"Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the world\\'s greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down.\" His name was Marshall Field and his store still exists, and in Hill\\'s words is \"a towering monument to that state of mind known as a burning desire.\" I lived in Chicago from 2002 through 2004 and worked three blocks away from this impressive store on State Street. Sometimes I would visit it or stand outside it to derive inspiration and be reminded of the power of desire. It is amazing that Hill describes \"burning desire\" with a story based on the Chicago Fire.There are thousands of self-help books out in the market and hundreds of self proclaimed \"gurus\" who have made a living by copying the wisdom in Hill\\'s books. As I went through some of those books I realized that there was not much in them that Hill had not already written about. I recommend quality over quantity. Instead of reading through many books, I recommend that you study the following works of Hill and internalize his wisdom:1. Think and Grow Rich (1937) - I recommend the Action Pack edition,2. Napoleon Hill\\'s Keys to Success : The 17 Principles of Personal Achievement - this is an excellent guide to his principles,3. Your Right To Be Rich [Unabridged] - this consists of 12 hours of live lectures covering the 17 principles, that Hill conducted in Chicago in 1954.By internalizing, I mean studying in depth - analyzing the ideas, making notes and summaries. I own more CDs by Hill, but I believe that these 3 items make the perfect study plan on the Philosophy of Personal Achievement.Some have criticized Hill\\'s work by stating that his research was unscientific. They pass him up for Jim Collins (whose \"Good to Great\" dedicates 76 out of its 300 pages to research methodology and notes that hardly anybody ever reads) or Marcus Buckingham (whose \"First Break...\" similarly uses 25 pages for Gallup\\'s Meta Analysis and what not). These people don\\'t know what they are missing.I am greatly indebted to Napoleon Hill. The purpose of my writing this is to spread awareness of his work so that more people can benefit from it. This, I believe is the best way in which Hill would have liked to have been repaid.If my review was helpful to you, I request you to select \"Yes\" so that the rating is improved and more readers will get to read it.

Its secret concern is with the origins of the Renaissance, historically and as an emblem of personal rebirth. The ending is really, really something.Beasts hides itself a bit also. In the dying America of a future Earth, biologically engineered man/animal hybrids attempt to throw off their chains and find a place in the world. They are variously aided and opposed by the novel's human beings, each of whom proves to be a very much distinct creature as well.

His \"Aegypt\" tetrology, not yet complete, is a piece of visionary work on an epic scale.  His only fault is that the writing is unclassifiable, so it has fallen between every conceivable crack.  Bad for sales.\"Engine Summer\" is the first of his novels, though the last of the early three to be published.  It leaves the others behind as a work of astonishing originality and almost hallucinogenic vision. (Crowley admits that his first draft was written at a time when he was smoking a lot of, well, you know.)  In this elegant and beautifully understated work (if it goes a little slowly at first, stick with it: it will sweep you away) the Crowley themes have a true beginning:  a world constantly transforming in which the only way that the history of the human as the strangest of races can really be kept alive is through the stories we tell.He has an enormous talent for inducing laughter of utter delight and rolling tears simultaneously.  His gift is in his humanity, his innate understanding of the deep pathos and utter ridiculousness of being self-conscious creatures in a world that is not and will never be wholly comprehensible.  Thus it is our stories that keep us sane. Barely.The future which he envisions (this is not the kind of future fantasy that even pretends to forsee the world as it might actually turn out) is one in which the split between the natural, instinctual half of our human dichotomy and the mental, synthetic one actually become separate species, with no real capacity to comprehend the other.  How this plays out through his richly detailed imagination and alchemical control of the Engish language is something to be experienced, not described.  The narrative device, which leaves us guessing until a breathtaking revelation at the end, is alone, worth the price.Get this book.  Read it.  Please.

Otherwise collects his three early novels, all nominally science fiction but so far from the stereotypical forms of that genre as to almost deserve their own literary classification.  In each of these small but perfectly formed jewels, Crowley demonstrates complete control of his medium.  In barely 200 pages, he creates and destroys worlds, makes us fall in love with his characters, and leaves us wanting more.Crowley's first novel, The Deep, takes place in a semi-mythical world in the throes of a war of succession.  Two factions, the Reds and the Blacks, are vying for the throne, and another group, the Just, have sworn to end the tyranny of all ruling houses.  Into this war comes a visitor, something not entirely human.  Due to injuries (or perhaps malfunctions) it is unable to carry out its mission, and ends up being drawn into human existence.  There is a dissonance between the two halves of the story - the medieval palace intrigue and the visitor's search for its purpose - that keeps The Deep from being a complete novel, but still one can't help but marvel at Crowley's skill.  Other authors writing about elaborate wars of succession and courtly machinations will sometimes fill thousands of pages without creating anything close to Crowley's instantly believable world and sympathetic characters.  Although it is ultimately not a completely successful novel, The Deep is beautiful and engaging.My personal favorite, Beasts, takes place in the not too distant future.  America has fractured into numerous autonomies which eye each other nervously and prepare for war.  Some decades previously, genetic experiments gave rise to animal-human hybrids, who now walk the earth as outcasts.  In Beasts, Crowley examines the animal in the human and the human in the animal by assembling a diverse and fascinating cast of characters - a human-lion messiah and the humans who flock to his call, a super-intelligent dog trying to fight his devotion to the race that made him, a tame hawk set loose in the wild.  Crowley examines the two-edged sword of intelligence and asks - is it better to be tame or wild?  Some reviewers have complained about Beasts' sudden ending, but to me it seems right, as the question can never be answered and there's already so much in the book to ponder.Engine Summer is my least favorite of the three books.  Its protagonist, Rush That Speaks, lives in a post-industrial world only vaguely aware of the technological society that preceded it.  Driven by wanderlust, curiosity, and love, Rush leaves his comfortable home and ventures out into the world.  Through his eyes, we discover the different societies and ideologies that have arisen in the wake of some great destruction, and eventually Rush brings his wisdom to the survivors of that destruction.  Although as beautiful as the other two books in its prose, I found Engine Summer cold and uninvolving.  There was no plot to speak of, and no characters that I could care for.Otherwise is a good introduction to Crowley's writing (although new readers might also begin with Little, Big, arguably Crowley's masterpiece).  These three short novels epitomize his strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and clearly demonstrate the promise that he's since lived up to.  A reader emerging from the depths of these three worlds can have no doubt - John Crowley is a treasure\"},\n",

As just one instance of this, Paul Johnson assures the reader that President Johnson was reluctant to escalate the Vietnam War.  He further assures us:  \"There is no evidence, as was later alleged, that the incident was contrived, to get America deeper into the war.\"   And further:  \"But congress, by an overwhelming majority, passed . . . the \"Tonkin Gulf Resolution\\' authoring the President to take vigorous measure to protect US forces.\"  One would think that if he going to make such a claim that he should at least explain why the Pentagon Papers so explicitly state that the official account of the Tonkin Gulf attack was a deliberate deception.  In the October HARPER\\'S article, \"The Next War,\" Daniel Ellsberg claims to have had drawerfuls of critical working papers, memos, estimates, and detailed escalation options revealing the evolving plans of the Johnson Administration for a wider war, expected to commence soon after the election.\"  Though far more inclined to trust Ellsberg than Johnson, either Paul or Lyndon, I admittedly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth, but I have not heard that the Pentagon Papers were not genuine.When Johnson is not simply lying, he uses facts to support a viewpoint which he himself must know to not be true.  \"Support for intensifying the war was always greatest among the under thirty-fives,\" (at least prior to November 1968, \"by which time the decision to get out had already been taken).\"  (By whom)?  Considering that the young had been nursed on heroic World War II movies, trained in blind \"patriotism\" and educated in such a manner as to preclude questioning governmental authority, what else was to be expected?  Once we woke up to what had been done to us, we, the American People, most definitely lost our stomach for the war.

Being both a Catholic and a political conservative who strongly believes in the existence of a well to do middle class, Johnson is searingly scathing of much of 20th century Communism, as well as socialism and other Leftist movements.  He is also highly critical of many Communist dictators, such as Stalin, Lenin, Mao, and Pohl Pot, who all effectively wiped out the middle classes in their country, and also the third-world revolutionaries like Chinua Achebe who argued strongly for violence to be used for political ends.In the conclusion, Johnson reserves his poison for the advocates of applying ideas from modern evolutionary biology to social problems, feeling this will result in several social disasters (however one can't help but feel Johnson's Catholicism at work here).Johnson is as usual not afraid to speak his mind when he feels it is right to do so.  In some works, this is a weakness, but in this one, I feel many of his points are spot on, especially when it comes to the awful tyrannies of too-powerful states, who were only too willing to wipe out entire sections of their people for political aims.

In general he has come to praise the colonialist English, Vichy France, Franco and Nixon; to savage FDR, JFK and labor unions.Much of his savaging is Monday morning (or Wednesday afternoon) quarterbacking. He claims 'moral relativism' as the scourge of the twentieth century while turning a blind eye when events don't fit his 'white mans burden' theory of post-colonialism. He blaims Leninism for everything but earthquakes and is ruthless in his hatred of state communism, state capitalism. He swings numbers around to trash post-war labor enough to deserve Twain's over used saw: Lies, damned lies and statistics.Blind of course to the morally relative shenanigans of Reagan and Thatcher, he doesn't come off as a revisionist so much as a self important old man settling old scores (take that, Roosevelt!) while remaining blissfully ignorant of the grey areas around his heros.However, he can write and he knows his subject.

He's unrelenting in his hatred of the Bolsheviks and Nazis, and as I agree I find much of his real-politik analysis very interesting and in many cases accurate.There are much better surveys of the 20th century, Martin Gilbert's comes to mind as his right wing spin doesn't kick in until 1968, but for the flavor of the times this is a tasty read.

Johnson sums up his own  philosophy with a quote from Alexander Pope: \"The proper study of mankind is man.\" His opinion of the 20th century cast of characters is scathing more often than not.He trashes Woodrow Wilson -- a sound judgment in my opinion -- defends Harding, claims Coolidge was a good President, is lukewarm toward Hoover, considers Roosevelt frivolous and empty-headed, favors Truman, and adores Eisenhower. Churchill is his great hero.  The totalitarians -- Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler -- are depicted as venal gangsters.  Johnson is unflinchingly anti-Communist throughout, an opinion that proved sound when the rot of the Soviet Union and its satellites became obvious in the late 1980s.  (The first edition of this book was published in 1983.)  Nehru, Gandhi and many other third world personalities get tossed into the category of lawyer/politicians with little to recommend them as leaders of countries.Fault can be found with Johnson; minor errors of fact and questionable statements dot the book -- and he rushes breathlessly on without defending many of his opinions.  However, if he argued them all out the book would be 10,000 pages long and dull as an airline steak knife.

Elie Wiesel survived years of torture, malnourishment, and dehumanizing conditions as he was forced to travel from one concentration camp to the next during the height of Nazi control. He was separated from his mother and sister and never saw them again. He watched his father gasp his last few breaths before authorities took him away during the night and disposed of him in a crematorium.This book is a scary and very real. It is like reading the words of a young boy\\'s diary- a young boy who is frightened and appalled at the acts of violence taking place around him; a boy who cannot understand why this is taking place but knows that he must reach for every ounce of courage within him to survive this living nightmare.The scenes Wiesel describes in this book will stir up all sorts of emotions in every person who reads them. Adults, kids, and even young babies are thrown into fire pits by the Nazis. Thirsty prisoners eat snow in the hope that it will provide some thirst quenching relief. Near- naked people are forced to sleep without any protection on frigid, snowy winter nights. Wiesel describes the events vividly; going from a naive youngster to a hardened prisoner as he is sent from one camp to the next. He is sometimes emotional at first. But after witnessing so much inhumanity he becomes emotionally numb to the injustice around him.The arrival of the allied forces brought an end to the nightmare for Elie Wiesel and other prisoners. Wiesel\\'s family members were not so lucky and he dedicates this book in memory of the three of them. He never saw his mother or sister after they were separated from him and his father so there is no way to know how they died. No one will ever know exactly how each person perished and the author doesn\\'t offer any predictions. It really doesn\\'t matter at this point anyway. His immediate family is gone, dead at the hands of a government out of control.This book is short, but it packs a tremendous punch. It serves as a reminder of the potential brutality of some people. And it also serves as a tribute to the human spirit: A tragic book that is also full of hope; showing how one young man was subjected to one of the most terrible human tragedies in history and lived to tell his painful story.

From the establishment of a ghetto in Elie\\'s home town of Sighet, the reader can only watch with growing horror as the young man and his family are swept up in the Holocaust.

Elie Wiesel\\'s story is one of one man\\'s courage, will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost; friends, family, belongings, even basic human dignity.What struck me more than anything else from his personal story was the retelling of the hanging of the three men (well, two men and one boy) while he was in one of the concentration camps.  Millions perished, but the way the boy who suffered during the hanging stayed with me.  His story is the story of millions who perished and who never got to tell their tale, and one of the few books I would call a must read.Different instances in the book I am quite sure will strike readers differently.  One of the things which struck me and stayed with me was how he kept on looking for God, even amidst the enormity man sometimes will carry out on his fellow man.  What also struck me was the woman on the train who was saw the flames at the camps even before they arrived.   And the times he scolded and questioned himself and his ethics for even thinking selfish thoughts even though he was dying.  I still think would I (could I?) do the same if I was in his terrible position?This book shows the worst of mankind, and sadly this terrible event known as the holocaust is not entirely unique in man\\'s history since the freeing of Elie Wiesel.  We have witnessed Rwanda firsthand in the 1990\\'s, and have been told by world authorities that \"this will never happen again.\"  Yet in modern day Sudan(and North Korea, and Tibet.....), we see much of the same.....the world turning its back on millions of people.

I was wonderfully surprised!This is one of the finest books on choosing and working with very young puppies I have ever read (and I have read MANY). The author\\'s experience and love of dogs is evident throughout, as well as his very clear admonishment of EVER being too harsh, or pushing any pup past his comfort level in exercises. The goal of the exercises with very young dogs is to build trust and confidence in the dog he will become.The book IS a little dated, very little is said about spay/neuter and crate training, and if there are any New Yorkers still tying their puppies to parking meters outside a store, they must not be very bright. But I thought the references to \"Women\\'s Lib\" were cute. Its now VERY un-PC to say that to get the dog you want, you are best off with a young, good pup instead of an adult rescue, but its true. \"Spanking\" is also VERY un-pc. While the author refers to it, he also repeatedly states that NO harsh discipline of any sort is appropriate for young pups. Considering it was written THIRTY years ago, I think its brilliant. He was actually saying back then that people confuse dog breeds \"train-ability\" and \"intelligence\"!Mr. Wolter\\'s experience is obviously tilted toward more \"eager to please\" breeds (most training books are) but because the book deals with very young puppies who haven\\'t really developed into the more aloof specimins they may become, the advice is still excellent. Your loving tone may be enough for a middle of the road retriever pup, but keeping focus for more independent types may require a treat or two and this can easily be worked into the exercises.The author assumes that it is being read by a dog lover who will make loving decisions. The format is such that the book MUST BE READ, not treated like a recipe book where you can just open to chapter SIT STAY. But its a great read and his style is easy and clear.The heartbreaking true story of a sweet pup that was subtly pushed too hard should be required reading for anyone working with a puppy.And just to be clear, the \"Protection\" part of the title means bark like hell and be VERY scary on command, or when strangers approach and nothing more.

Prahalid does note the impediments, and is realistic about them.Supplying market needs is helpful to people by providing them access and affordability to the products they need.  Beyond this, what can be achieved once these market niches are filled?  Again, Prahalid uses a lot of charts, graphs, and stats to outline current challenges, and also the specific ways to address them.  Prahalid lists logistics, payment methods, transportation, etc.One concept advocated is \"creating the capacity to consume\" in these poor countries, facilitated by the \"single serving revolution.\"  This single serving marketing approach is for sales of smaller packages of products instead of larger ones because lower income people in BOPs can\\'t afford to buy larger packages and quantities and put them on the shelf at home for later use.  Good value for a good product, with a good portion-to-cost ratio. Some small packaged single servings specifically listed by Prahalad are: \"ketchup, tea, shampoo, coffee,and aspirin.\"  Trivial products, many of us in the world use.  Going farther and beyond these items would help, however: and, Prahalid does.  In addition, his concept of the \"Three As\" is realistic in this approach to marketing: Affordability, Access, Availability.Some of the bureaucratic policies and private industries noted:citizen-centric governance, e-governance, the salt industry in India, landmines and prosthetics, eye care, rural kiosks, training, deliveries, and supply-chains, etc.Prahahlid noted the challenges to implementation.  Ideas and words are quite different from implementation. (The doing.)  This book\\'s ideas can be helpful in certain circumstances and in many areas of the world.  There is opportunity to implement these concepts, There are however, many hurdles to implementing them and achieving success.  Will people at the BOP make the behavioral changes needed?  Changing mentalities is where it starts.  Are these recommendations, a form of cultural imperialism to some degree?  One obstacle is corruption;it\\'s rampant in many of these BOP countries.  A high percentage of aid and investments are stolen throughout the world.  Multi-national companies (MNCs) are often squeezed.  Theft, corruption, and judiciary systems are built to work against foreigners and obstruct them, while these BOP nations depend upon them. NGOs acquire and spend a lot of money.  What do they actually do?  Not much, as a whole.  NGO corruption and embezzlement is endemic.  Aid is used by governments of the \"developed world\" to push forward its own agendain these nations.  Aid, is a carrot and a stick at the same time.In these nations there is no concern for individuals.  Governments of BOP nations care about large corporations that dump millions of dollars of FDI into these countries. These MNCs often flush millions down the drain to get into these nations to get market share, reduced labour-costs, and to often export what they produce in BOPs nations to consumers in highly developed countries. Outsourcing is the latest motivator for the globalized competitive world where MNCs wield enormous power.  Where do the 4 billion people Prahalad mentions as living on $2 USD per day fit into this?  at the BOC (Bottom of theCompany).   Author Prahalid states: \"The process must start withrespect for Bottom of Pyramid consumers as individuals.\"  Consumers? Target marketing aspirin, coffee, and shampoo.If foreigners can be the saviour, how long will they have to stay? This sounds like a business oriented financial quid-pro-quo with the time-consuming and often ineffective Peace Corps approach: \"We can do things better than you can.  So let us come.  Let us in.  We\\'re doing you a favor, while we\\'re furthering our interests at the same time. Mutual benefits to some degree, but what is the ratio?  Different parties want access to the pie. If the entire pie grows and greaterpieces and access of it are available to those who have less, those who have nothing or little, will in theory get a larger piece of the bigger pie.  An element of Game Theory, perhaps.There are 6.3+ billion people on this planet, and the population is contueing to rise rapidly.  Water and food will take prevalence over economic growth if something is not done about it. Lack of these basic necessities needed for basic survival will obstruct the prospect for economic growth and better quality of life.  And, developed nations plunder world\\'s the environment and harm the lives of those with less political and economic power. We live in one world, not three.  What we do, more than ever, affects the entire population.  This is a very positive book, with realistic means to achieve its aims.Ideas, facts, and realistic methods are superbly tied together in\"Bottom of the Pyramid.\"  The biographies at the back of the book add depth to the people involved.  A Highly recommend book for everyone, and in particular those in Internationally Development, Intl. business, MNCs, and government.  Great book.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'On the one hand this book is endorsed by Microsoft\\'s Bill Gates and Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.  That ought give the prospective reader some idea of its value.  On the other hand, it might be asked, what kind of book is this that purports to tell businessmen how to make money by selling goods and services to the poorest people on earth?  After all, the poorest people that have any disposable income at all make something like two dollars a day.First question then is, how big is the market at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP)?  Prahalad writes that China\\'s per capita gross domestic product of $1000 really represents a dollar purchasing power parity (PPP) several times that, resulting in a $5-trillion dollar economy.  He sees the Indian economy as being worth about $3-trillion in PPP terms. (p. 10)  It\\'s easy to see that even the apocryphal \"two dollars a day\" multiplied by two, three or four billion or so results in a whole lot of money.The second thing that might be asked is, is it really moral for the business world to turn its considerable powers of inducement and persuasion on people who have so little to begin with?  What kind of person would aim to exploit those least able to afford the exploitation?  The answer given persuasively by Prahalad is that by making products and services available to the poor, two good things will happen.  First is the fact that goods and services hitherto unavailable to the poor will actually become available.  Second, these products and services will increase their standard of living and allow them to \"acquire the dignity of attention and choices from the private sector that were previously reserved for the middle-class and rich.\" (p. 20)How might this work?  Presently people in the poorest neighborhoods in the world ironically often pay a premium for what little goods and services they get.  Prahalad points out that this is because they are paying a \"poverty penalty\" which is the \"result of inefficiencies in access to distribution and [because of] the role [played by]...local intermediaries.\"  By \"local intermediaries\" he means the line of middlemen--some traditional, some corrupt, some both--that presently stand between the poor and their products and services.  These middlemen add no value but have their hands out and therefore artificially increase prices for the people at the BOP.  Products using modern distribution methods will undersell the old ways.Prahalad emphasizes targeting products precisely to the needs of the poor.  BOP people are \"value-conscious by necessity,\" he argues, and contrary to what might be assumed are \"very brand-conscious.\"  They are interested in \"aspiration products\"--brand names--since these products symbolize a higher standard of living and a better way of life.  We can see this in our own poor neighborhoods where brand icons like Nike and Sony are almost worshiped.  Prahalad notes that the \"poor have unpredictable income streams.  Many subsist on daily wages and...tend to make purchases only when they have cash and buy only what they need for that day.\"  Consequently a good marketing strategy is to offer \"single-service packaging--be it shampoo, ketchup, tea and coffee, or aspirin...\"This may work I believe if, and only if, the products that big business makes available to the people at the BOP really do improve the quality of their lives.  If they are persuaded to buy, say, cigarettes which they would not otherwise buy, clearly this will not improve the quality of their lives.  If they are persuaded to buy soft drinks and other artificial \"foods\" consisting of empty calories, it\\'s doubtful that they will benefit.But is all of this more \"globalization trickle down\"?--that is, the rich get richer and the poor get--well, somewhat less poor?  Prahalad believes that turning the people at the BOP into consumers will raise their standard of living and in the long run eradicate poverty.  He uses the phrase \"creating the capacity to consume\" as a means to this end.The unstated assumption behind Prahalad\\'s idea (and the consumptive economy in general) is that there is great wealth in the world that only needs to be created by human ingenuity, and then efficiently distributed by the capabilities of the modern corporation.  If we can find an energy source as cheap as oil and make a smooth transition to an oil-less economy, I think there is a good chance that Prahalad\\'s vision will be realized.  However, if we don\\'t solve the coming energy problem, Prahalad\\'s idea will gather dust and decay like so many abandoned SUVs alongside roads that we can\\'t afford to repair.In a sense then, this could be a visionary book well ahead of its time'},\n",

       "  'text': 'As Prahalad explains in his Preface, he wrote this book to suggest and explain a new approach by which to solve the social and economic problems of 80% of humanity. His approach would mobilize the resources, scale, and scope of multinational corporations  (MNCs) -- their investment capacity -- in a co-creative partnership with localized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in order to formulate and then implement \"unique\" solutions to the problems of 4 billion people who live on less than $2 a day at the bottom of the \"pyramid\" to which the book\\'s title refers. \"The process must start with respect for Bottom of Pyramid consumers as individuals. The process of co-creation assumes that consumers are equally important joint problem-solvers....New and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned. That is a challenge.\"Prahalad carefully organizes his material within three Parts. First, he provides a framework for the active engagement of the private sector and suggests  a basis for a profitable win-win engagement. He identifies all manner of adjustments, accommodations,  and (yes) sacrifices each of the \"players\" - MNCs, NGOs, and the poor themselves -- must be willing to make to ensure the success of the process. Next, he carefully and eloquently examines 12 case studies which involve a wide variety of businesses,  each an exemplar of innovative practices, \"where the BOP is becoming an active market and bringing benefits far beyond just products to consumers.\" All of the companies share the same concern: \"They want to change the face of poverty by bringing to bear a combination of high-technology solutions, private enterprise, market-based solutions, and involvement of multiple organizations.\" As for Part III, it is provided as a CD which consists of 35 minutes of video success stories filmed on location in the BOP in India, Peru, Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela.Of special note is the fact that the various stories are told almost entirely from the perspective of BOP consumers, the so-called  poor. As Prahalad points out, they get products and services at an affordable price, \"but more important, they get recognition, respect, and fair treament.  Building self-esteem and entrepreneurial drive at the BOP is probably the most enduring contribution that the private sector can make.\" As this book\\'s subtitle correctly suggests,  the ultimate objective is to eradicate poverty through profits...initiating and then sustaining what will be in fact, a win-win-win engagement of MNCs, NGOs, and the poor themselves.Of special interest to me is what Prahalad has to say about innovation for BOP markets which must become \"value-centered\" from the consumer\\'s perspective. He  identifies and then rigorously examines  12 principles for innovation in those markets such as \"creating a new price performance envelope\" and \"education of customers on product usage.\"  The BOP focuses attention on both the objective and subjective performances of the given product or service. Moreover, it must \"also focus on the need for 30 to 100 times improvements in price performance. Even if the need is only for 10 to 20 times improvement, the challenge is formidable.\"Although Prahalad has a compelling vision, he has neither illusions nor delusions about the difficulty of fulfilling that vision when undertaking the \"new approach\" he recommends in this book. His vision is bold, indeed of global proportions. However, his feet are planted firmly on the ground at the bottom of an enormous pyramid, one whose complexities are exceeded only by the unprecedented entrepreneurial opportunities it offers to help solve the social and economic problems of 80% of humanity. Given the importance and the urgency of the various issues which Prahalad explores so brilliantly in this book, there seem to be no acceptable alternatives to the approach he proposes.Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Vijay Mahajan and Kamini Banga\\'s  The 86 Percent Solution: How to Succeed in the Biggest Market Opportunity of the Next 50 Years and Kenichi Ohmae\\'s  The Next Global Stage: The Challenges and Opportunities in Our Borderless World.'},\n",

Aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth, improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models, distribution channels, product development or business processes.Having grown up and worked in India in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued.However, the case studies suggest this has changed and in many ways as far as India is concerned this is visible by strong anecdotal evidence. Also in many ways there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that people have realised that the government will not solve all that makes doing business difficult and have been using this kind of thinking as a driver for entrepreneurial business which also have a positive impact on the people at the bottom of the pyramid.Will The framework and ideas apply in all developing economies , specially with smaller populations ?

       "  'text': 'This is the intense, profound, almost unbearably sad story of Swede Levov, brought to life in the audio version by a mind-blowing performance by Ron Silver.The Swede was the hero of narrator Nathan Zuckerman\\'s youth, the \"household Apollo of the Weequahic [New Jersey] Jews.\"  The Swede\\'s blond good looks and athletic prowess became \"the repository of all their hopes\" -- and allowed the neighborhood to forget the war.To Zuckerman, the Swede had been the embodiment of the hero of his favorite childhood book, \"The Kid From Tomkinsville.\"  The Kid was a star ball player, a \"modest, serious, chaste, loyal, naive, undiscourageable, hard-working, soft-spoken, courageous\" boy, who, in the final pages of the book, was struck down on the field and carried off inert through the mob on a stretcher.  Zuckerman had secretly viewed this story as an augur of the Swede\\'s own life.  Zuckerman had wondered if it had occurred to the Swede \"that if disaster could come and strike down the Kid from Tomkinsville, it could come and strike the great Swede down too?\"The Swede\\'s mythic power stays with Zuckerman throughout his life.  Forty-five years later, out of the blue, the Swede contacts Zuckerman -- now a renowed writer --  and invites him to dinner, ostensibly to talk about the Swede\\'s father.  Zuckerman accepts the invitation, but is incredibly disappointed in how the Swede has turned out.  Although he still had the face and physique of a God, the Swede seems to be almost unbearably bland -- every word from his mouth is good natured and unobjectionable.Zuckerman sadly concludes that the Swede has turned out to be \"the embodiment of nothing,\" but soon finds out that his assessment of the Swede is wrong.  A few months after the dinner, Zuckerman runs into the Swede\\'s younger brother Jerry at their forty-five-year high school reunion. Jerry reveals that an unbelievable, unthinkable tragedy had befallen the Swede twenty-five years before, and the horror of that event had destroyed the Swede\\'s life.For the rest of the book, Zuckerman explores \"the brutality of the destruction of this indestructible man.\"  Zuckerman imagines the Swede\\'s internal life over the course of a half-century.  The Swede\\'s story unfolds in a spiralling structure that goes back and forth through time, as the Swede obsessively tries to make sense of the inexplicable.Through the Swede\\'s ruminations, Roth explores incredibly weighty themes: a parent\\'s love for a child, the nature of perfection, the randomness of life, the delusion of control and moderation, and the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to figure out why things are. Most of all, Roth seems to struggle with the notion that there cannot be depth without suffering, and that without that depth, life would be meaningless.  You get the feeling that Roth wishes he could appreciate the ordinary guy -- the bland, honorable, decent people who live their lives with relative equilibrium.  Roth seems to regret that it is only the Swede\\'s tragedy that makes him interesting, and that it is only in imagining the Swede\\'s excrutiating pain that Roth can identify with him.Overall, the book\\'s tone is intense and dark, but there are moments of humor that are funnier than just about anything I\\'ve ever read.  Roth\\'s description of the Valentine\\'s gift that the fifteen-year-old Jerry makes for his secret crush had me laughing for days.'},\n",

I know he has written some other stuff, but my mind has not yet been corrupted by it. OK, so what is my opinion of American Pastoral?For starters, I think the style is a lot like that of Joseph Conrad in Lord Jim (the only Conrad I have read). There are pages  upon pages of diversions from the main plot; lengthy descriptions of people sitting around at dinner tables; single events that are analyzed and re-analyzed from every possible angle, and then re-analyzed again. This type of literature is often fascinating but can quickly become tiresome, so I am not surprised that some of the Amazon reviewers were not able to finish the book. As far as readability is concerned, this book gets a B+. Delicious in places, starchy in others.Now, what about the main point that Roth is trying to make?He wants to tell us something fundamental about the All-American Man. He wants us to re-think our concept of the Successful American. He wants us to examine the American Dream closely and see what lies beneath its surface. He wants us to look behind the facade of beauty pageants and country clubs and face lifts and Little League and white teeth and football and big muscles and all that other good stuff we cherish about America.In this book, Roth tries to lift the veil and show us the real America.Is he successful?Sort of. For example, the fetid mess that propels All-American Swede toward insanity is masterfully portrayed. The mental breakdown of our All-American Hero is wonderfully choreographed. The Hero's slow descent into hell is captured page by page in exquisite detail.However, depsite all this terrific stuff, I came away with the odd notion that Roth himself may be slightly out of touch. This book is clearly written from the perspective of an older generation. The younger generation is seen as infantile, petulant, irksome, depraved, and so forth. Adolesence, to Roth, apparently has few redeeming features. Youth exists simply to torment the elderly, the Establishment. Roth, and his cast of bittersweet characters, are sadly on the wrong side of the hill. I don't want to say that Roth comes off looking like a grumpy old man. So I won't say it. I'll just think it.Lesson I learned from reading this book: if you are lucky enough to get a chance to live the American Dream, live it by all means! Enjoy! But, if you do decide you want to live the American Dream,  go in with your eyes wide open. The American Dream is more complicated than it looks!Read the book if you have already lived your American Dream and you want to compare notes with somebody else who has been there, done that, too.Pass on this book if you are youthful, optimistic, and your Dream is still alive.

The controversy: do dogs have a true language or do they not?Having recently rewatched Miracle on 34th Street, I recall Kris Kringle\\'s attorney\\'s comment on the controversy over belief in Santa Clause.  \"Some firmly believe in him, others just as strongly deny his existence.\"  In keeping with the spirit of the season when we\\'re a little more likely than usual to believe that animals speak, it\\'s a great time to buy this book as a present for a serious dog lover on your list.It seems obvious to me that Coren takes the controversy seriously; taking it to the people is not a cop out.  Rather his singular achievement is to bring a body of evidence, if you will, to pet owners who normally would not be part of this academic jury. While reading How To Speak Dog, again and again I\\'d find myself exclaiming \"Wow, that\\'s Oliver\\'s call to be let in, or so that\\'s what Emmie is saying to Hannah.\"After completing my first read, I kept the book on the end table having dog eared (sorry, couldn\\'t resist) the section entitled \"Doggish Phrase Book\".  This Doggish-English dictionary is a must-have for your next visit to the park where Doggish is the language of the land.  Stanley, \"May I call you Stanley?\", has organized the phrasebook by sounds, and by ear, eye, facial, tail, and other body signals.  Then for each phrase he provides the human meaning, corresponding emotions and conditions of the dog when the phrase is uttered.  Basically, \"This is what the dog is saying when you see and hear this behavior.\"Often, for weeks after I finished the book, whenever I\\'d hear a bark, a whine, a howl, or see a crooked tail I\\'d pop open the phrase book and compare Coren\\'s interpretation to my own.I\\'ve often found myself recommending this book to friends, psychologists and other dog lovers. As a sociologist myself I\\'ve always been interested in cross cultural communication.  Over time, little by little I came to realize I\\'d become even more interested in cross-species communication between people and dogs. Progress has been slow.  I guess it\\'s hard to study cultural differences when you don\\'t understand the language.  But I digress.So, back to the basic question.  \"Oh, yes\", Stanley concludes, dogs have a language. There are four generally accepted key requirements for language and dogs show all four, one to a lesser extent than the other three:* Meaningfulness - canine sounds and signals are not random, but convey a specific meaning* Displacement -- the ability to target things not currently in sight \"Go get the ball in the kitchen.\"* Display rules of combination -- some combinations are not meaningful when used together. Dogs don\\'t lay down to get a tummy rub and seriously growl at the same time* Productivity - the ability to put words together in novel ways.Stanley acknowledges that productivity is weak (though it does exist) in Doggish.  But the same is true in human toddlers and few would argue that toddlers have no language, just that they understand far more than they can express in words.So, while at this time of year, I\\'m especially willing to believe in Santa, I find that all year long I\\'m willing to believe dogs have a language.  Thanks, Stanley.  I won\\'t be surprised if my peers in the jury decide to vote the same, \"Yes, Virginia, dogs do have language.'},\n",

I especially like the book\\'s detailed descriptions of a dog\\'s specific body language (ears, eyes, mouth, tail) and what each means--as well as its guide to the messages a dog is sending when he barks or whines in a particular way. Not unlike a driver\\'s training manual which must be read by those who wish to become licensed drivers, \\'How to Speak Dog\" should be required reading for every person who decides to share his or her life with a dog.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he\\'s only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people\\'s interest and sell more copies...The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I\\'ll say, \"What do we do on an elevator?\" and they\\'ll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, \"Look!  They understand every word you say!\"Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying \"What do we do on an elevator?-we sit.\"  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from \"What do we do on an elevator?\" to \"Sit\" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn\\'t my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it\\'s my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog \"understands\" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it\\'s far more likely that the dog\\'s response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there\\'s a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I\\'m sorry, Stan, but real language doesn\\'t operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that\\'s a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.Look, it\\'s fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren\\'t (which isn\\'t always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can\\'t be.  It\\'s not grammar or syntax, it\\'s emotion, pure and simple.Even if Coren hadn\\'t thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he\\'d spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he\\'d know that a dog\\'s brain has no Broca\\'s area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he\\'s written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn\\'t seem to care much about the truth.Still, I have to admit that it\\'s hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we\\'re constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we\\'re almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog\\'s feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, \"Do you love me?\" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.It\\'s a shame that Coren doesn\\'t get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.If I could I\\'d give this book no stars at all'},\n",

Things go badly and the evil Count Olaf shows up with another nefarious plan to kidnap the children and somehow steal their inheritance. In the end they get away and Olaf is on the run from the authorities. The ending of The Vile Village changes this. The Baudelaires are on the run, suspected of the murder of Count Olaf despite the fact that he isn't dead and that there is no way they could have committed the non-existent crime. The Hostile Hospital opens with the orphans trying to find a place where they can learn about VFD, the Quagmire triplets, and some clue that will help keep them safe and stop Count Olaf from coming after them ever again. This time there is no Mr. Poe and no new distant relative to live with. Count Olaf is in much less of this book than we have come to expect, though he and his cronies play major roles in instigating the action.Author Lemony Snicket (an assumed name as the author is as much a character in the story as the Baudelaires are) does an excellent job in presenting the story of the Baudelaires experiences at a hospital trying to research in the records room what the truth behind the events of the past several novels and once more running afoul of the minions of Count Olaf and being placed into mortal danger once again. Snicket sets up the next volume very well and tells the story in such a way that the novel flows into the next book while telling an independent story at the same time.

       "  'text': 'As a real estate investor and author myself, I read a lot of real estate books. Many, if not most, are written by folks who do not invest in real estate themselves; they only write about it. Berges is not one of them. He knows his stuff and it\\'s clear that he practices what he preaches. I have read three of his books and, I must say, he\\'s one of my favorite real estate authors. You can trust what he says. Experienced investors may want a bit more detail from Steve, but what he does say is accurate and safe. This is a good book on buying apartments. In fact, in my own book, \"Investing in Duplexes, Triplexes  Quads,\" I list the best books I\\'ve read on different areas of real estate. This book is the ONLY book I recommend on investing in commercial multifamily (ie, apartments of 5 units and up) properties.Having given those accolades, here are a few of my constructive criticisms:1. On pages 37 and 38, Steve gives nice charts illustrating the long-term financial benefits of investing in multifamily properties. On page 39, however, there is an error in referring to the big numbers shown. The reference is made to Investor A\\'s \"equity\" of $2.1 million and Investor B\\'s (the multifamily property investor) equity of $92 million. I just don\\'t think Steve caught this, but those numbers don\\'t refer to the investor\\'s equity, but to the fair market value of his collective assets (his properties). The investor\\'s equity might be in the range of 20% of that. I do like the charts, however, and I used a similar analysis in my recent book. One other note on the charts - they presume selling and buying exactly at the end of one year - a difficult task as Steve would surely admit. On average, I think 18 months to two years is a better time frame for flipping apartments.2. Refinancing - Steve didn\\'t give a chart showing the long-range effect of the \"buy, hold and refy\" strategy (using proceeds to buy again, but retaining the first property). In addition, Steve only mentioned the general banking guideline that you can only pull out cash up to 80% of the new appraised value (i.e., the bank has an LTV of 80%). However, you can get around this. I\\'ve done it. It requires a second lender giving a second mortgage, with a CLTV (combined loan to value) of up to 90%. As such, you can pull out much more cash.3. GRM - gross rent multiplier. In his financial analysis section, Steve doesn\\'t give much detail or provide real life examples on this crucial analysis factor. Granted, the cap rate is the analysis primarily used for commercial real estate, while the GRM is the one used for residential multifamily (2-4 units) real estate. Since many owners and selling brokers will \"fudge\" on expenses, a cap rate can be very hard to verify. The GRM, however, is fairly simple - just look at the lease agreements.4. Lack of coverage on residential multifamily apartments. In fact, this is why I wrote my book on this topic. If Steve had covered it here, I would not have written mine. I like Steve\\'s writing style and he knows his stuff. But for investing in small multifamily properties (certainly on residential, but probably up to about 10 units), we really have to cover valuation and selection of properties using the GRM. That and I felt like the \"buy, hold, and refy\" strategy needed much more coverage.But for investing in commercial multifamily properties, I recommend this book as the only good one on the market.Larry LoftisAuthor: Investing in Duplexes, Triplexes and Quads: The Fastest and Safest Way to Real Estate Wealth'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own.I own this book...this play because I read it while in a Humanities course in college. I went to college rather \"late\" in life...whatever that means...and yet I derived more from the experience than I probably would have had I gone right after High School. I am one of those people who believe that it\\'s not college that makes a \"well-rounded\" indivividual, but life experience. If colleges and universities handed out degrees based on Life Experience, I\\'d probably have a doctorate three times over...We were given the assignment of reading this play and seeing the live production that the college I was attending just so happened to be putting on. With my primary focus being on philosphy, I embraced the Existentialism Unit that we were now focused upon. My best friend, who was/is an \"atheist\" was less receptive of these Existentialist ideas he considered strange and elusive. You think he, being an atheist, would have been more open to them than I who had already been bitten by the Metaphysics/Spirituality plague. Truth be told I think the only reason he says he\\'s an atheist is because he\\'s a cheapskate and doesn\\'t want to shell out extra money for Christmas gifts.So we go see this play and people were getting pretty agitated. In this play everything goes round and round but never arrives at any final conclusions and I noticed how we, as a society, love our answers. We are not soothed by questions and proposistions and \"what if?\" scenarios. We feel the need to latch onto something because something is better than nothing.Isn\\'t it?The Existentialists believe that the universe is random, chaotic, and ultimately meaningless and so in a sense they \"give\" meaning to meaninglessness. Just like an atheist believes in non-belief. You see, the human species cannot not give meaning to his/her life...we cannot not believe...we can \"pretend\" that life is without meaning and that we don\\'t believe but everything that falls onto the screen of our perception, will take on the shape of our perceptions.I loved this play. I loved the merry-go-round type dialouge. Isn\\'t this what we all do? We get a belief so engrained in our heads and we think that it is the only way to believe and so we spend a lot of time trying to convince someone who may not be as receptive to our point of view as to why it\\'s valid. What I have learned over the years is that the only reason why a belief is valid is because we are the ones who validate it. It doesn\\'t make us \"more right\" than the person who doesn\\'t believe it, it just makes us believers of the belief. And contrary to popular opinion, the more people you have who also believe the same way you believe does not prove that it\\'s any more valid than if only one person believed it.This play did not dissolve me into a puddle of desperation and futileness, in fact it added more meaning to my life which would probably make Samuel Beckett gag. It made me fall in love even more with this crazy life that only I can live. Nobody lives by proxy. Each of us are liberated and imprisoned by our beliefs. The best we can ever hope to be is determined by what we are willing to believe at any given time. This is why it\\'s a good practice to sit down and journal about your beliefs from time to time and question why you still believe what you believe. You may have outgrown certain beliefs, certain ideas, certain ways of being in the world but don\\'t be like the two \"bums\" in the play, don\\'t keep postponing what it is that you eventually desire to see; see it now, live it now, be it now. If you are going to be an atheist, be the best atheist you can be. If you are going to be a Christian, be the best Christian you can be. If you are going to be an Anarchist, be the best Anarchist you can be. Just don\\'t think that everyone is going to believe exactly as you believe and don\\'t make others wrong simply because they may have another point of view. In the end, none of us truly know what\\'s on the other side. Yes, we\\'ve had people with Near Death Experiences, but nobody has ever come back after being completely dead with a report, we just have reports from people who have been \"mostly dead\".Take life with a grain of salt and enjoy the ride.Peace  Blessings.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Waiting for Godot was dubbed a \"tragicomedy\" and there doesn\\'t seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play.  The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work.  However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you.  Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be.  Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own.  What I love the most about this book is Beckett\\'s ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality.  Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous.  Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale.  Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold.

       "  'text': 'Samuel Beckett\\'s play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them. Is Godot God? Are Didi and Gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive, or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering?Waiting for Godot, in proper Modernist fashion, strips away all the layers of narrative and form and leaves nothing but the naked husk of a play, which Beckett no doubt felt revealed the human condition at its most basic. But the play\\'s power doesn\\'t really come from that. Rather, what makes Waiting for Godot so compelling is its wide applicability: it\\'s a story about random oppression, brutality, and dreams deferred by harsh realities. It has been performed as an allegory of apartheid South African, the Jim Crow South, the horror of the war in Bosnia and about every other possible situation imaginable. Why? Because as Benjamin Kunkel pointed out in a piece in The New Yorker not so long ago, \"[N]ot everyone has a God, but who doesn\\'t have a Godot?\"Beyond the metaphysical implications of the play, though, it\\'s popularity stems from its near-perfection: for all the philosophical meaning people see in it, the action progresses with virtually no direct reference to it, and every line which seems to suggests some sort of grand significance has a very concrete meaning in the action. Take the infamous opening: Estragon, the first of the tramps, struggles to pull off his boot to relieve his swollen foot. Unable to get it off, he gives up and announces \"Nothing to be done.\" Vladimir, wincingly wandering onto the stage and grasping at his crotch (precious few readers and actors for that matter seem to grasp that one of the play\\'s running jokes is Vladimir\\'s venereal disease, which causes him immense pain when urinating), thinks Estragon is commenting on his own ailment, and announces, \"I\\'m beginning to come round to that conclusion myself. All my life I\\'ve put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven\\'t yet tried everything! And I resumed the struggle.\"On the one hand, the lines relate concretely to the action of the play; on the other, they have become representative of modern man\\'s ambivalence towards a cruel and uncaring world, and such clever cynicism has linked Beckett to the French Existentialists in whose circles he moved after the Second World War. But seen merely as declamatory statements of world-weary cynicism, the lines lose all their power; Beckett\\'s achievement comes from his ability to link such nihilistic sentiments to extremely comic moments, and it is the humor that carries the reader or the theatergoer through what would otherwise be an unbearably cynical  play. Steve Martin, who played Vladimir in a famous 1982 production at the Lincoln Center in New York, put it best when he said that he sought to serve the humor of the play, because the meaning could carry itself but the humor could not. That\\'s a lesson which, sadly, precious few theater directors seem to grasp, but which the careful reader discovers in Beckett. Definitely a must-read, but read it before seeing it, because few productions do it justice'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct.In short, this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language, to strip life down to a mere game of waiting. That is, in essence, what this is all about. We have two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up. They don't know why. They don't know exactly when he will be there. Still they wait, eternally, by the tree, by wherever they think he said he would show.This isn't an absurdist play, although it has been labeled as such. Absurdism, though, seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece. We oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex, that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story, but with Waiting for Godot, we have a simple theme: waiting.The two characters symbolize nothing. They are, quite simply, not waiting to be analyzed. They become, in effect, victims of Samuel Beckett's own game: they are his quotation, and he only says what needed to be said at the time, and so he wrote it, whether people would catch on or not, whether they would label it absurdism or not.If you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud, very slowly, word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion, you would probably capture the idea. If it's any indication, he wrote everything in French first--his second language--and then translated it in to English, just so it can be simple. I don't assume, of course, that this work should be cherished simply because it's an exercise in simplicity. But I submit that it should be cherished because it's a genuine, themeless--somehow--masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant, unknown thing that may or may not ever come. It is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous, but somehow, it manages to charm. It is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again, and it has no lyrics, and no meaning--as far as you know--but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity\"},\n",

I remain skeptical. There are a few moments of wry humor, but not enough to make up for the emptiness of \"waiting.\" There is literally \"Nothing to be done\" in this play. \"Waiting\" is a non-action.

The course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy; thus there is a strong Christian element.

It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross\\'s classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman\\'s case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross\\'s overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Bereavement:  Counseling the Grieving throughout the Life Cycle is a compact little book that covers the basics of grief counseling.  Author David A. Crenshaw Ph.D. presents his theory of the tasks of mourning that must be accomplished in order for the grieving individual to attain a healthy resolution to the loss.  These tasks appear to owe an acknowledgement to the five stages of grief proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.  Crenshaw goes on to apply his seven tasks to six identified life cycle stages:  preschool children, school-age children, adolescents, young adults, adults in midlife, and the elderly, using abbreviated case histories as examples.The book provides an overview of the grieving process and some basic suggestions for interventions with people in the various age groups.  It does not, however, give the amount of in-depth information and hands-on detail that would be required to help a counselor develop proficiency in counseling the bereaved.  In attempting to cover such a wide array of populations in a small book, Crenshaw sacrifices specificity.  The longest chapter is devoted to the preschool aged child with the main thrust of his recommendations being monologues that the counselor delivers to the child.  He only minimally mentions play therapy, arguably the most effective type of therapy for children in this age group.  This reviewer finds the omission of play therapy techniques for the bereaved child to be the most serious lack in this book.Bereavement is an interesting and highly readable book that gives some good basic information.  The counselor interested in developing effective grief resolution therapy skills would do well to use this book as a starting point from which to begin building her skills and then follow it with more in-depth publications devoted to the specific population she is counseling.Reviewed by:Kathleen C.

If there is a problem with the book, it is only that she is perhaps too familiar with the plays and is unable to be truly critical of them.The book begins with a lengthy introduction which serves as a biography of Shakespeare and provides a bit of historical context for his body of work.  Then we get a chapter on each of thirty-eight plays, including The Two Noble Kinsmen, which is not always included in Shakespeare collections.  The plays are presented in rough chronological order and focus only secondarily on plot, with a greater emphasis on character and the use of language.Garber is a good writer, and each chapter is insightful.  As this is written more as a collection of essays, there is not always perfect continuity between chapters and there is more than a little redundancy (which I suppose does make this easier to read this work in portions or out of order). As stated before, however, the principal flaw in her writing is that she refuses to say anything really critical about any of the plays.  In Garber\\'s view, Shakespeare batted 1.000, all hits and no misses.  Henry VIII seems to be just as worthy of merit as Othello or Hamlet.   Furthermore, there are no mistakes; any apparent contradictions or omissions are cleverly intended, not just an error.Certainly, Shakespeare is worth a lot of praise.  When you consider what he did - writing over three dozen plays with an adeptness that is readily apparent - he is definitely deserving of the title \"genius,\" but he wasn\\'t perfect.  It would be nice if Garber acknowledged this, but her strengths clearly outweigh her weaknesses, and if you are interested in learning more about Shakespeare\\'s plays, this is a worthwhile way to get that education.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I bought this book on the strength of Marjorie Garber\\'s excellent past Renaissance scholarship. I was expecting something more theoretically informed and original, but as it is this is a very worthwhile book, and I predict it will be an essential reference book for teachers and students. It\\'s a BIG book with a substantial chapter on each play (but not the sonnets), as with Harold Bloom\\'s book on Shakespeare. Garber, however, is less idiosyncratic than Bloom; She synthesizes the best of recent scholarship, but without footnotes or extensive theorizing a la Derrida and Lacan. Garber combines close attention to language with valuable historical background and context. For example, in her chapter on Macbeth, she relates a \"new critical\" analysis of the clothing imagery to  sumptuary laws regarding clothing (laws which served to enforce the social hierachy of Renaissance England). The strengths of this book are her comprehensive discussions of the play, which sum up what we know for sure about the plays including the relevant historical contexts, and her brilliant analysis of Shakespeare\\'s language, i.e., close reading. While her work is illuminated by recent scholarship, she avoids the Stalinesque imperatives of political correctness. Compare Garber\\'s intelligent discussion of the problem of gender in Macbeth with Stephen Orgel\\'s \"introduction\" in The Complete Pelican Shakespeare, in which he reductively reads the play as a \"misogynist fantasy.\" The only reason I docked the book one star is that, based on the chapters I\\'ve read so far, she doesn\\'t really make a  major original contribution to Shakespeare studies (in contrast to, for example, Greenblatt\\'s recent bio of Shakespeare, Will in the World) so much as synthesize what we already know. All in all, a very valuable reference book that I will be consulting regularly in my college teaching. Highly recommended for high school teachers, English majors (undergraduate and graduate), and all fans of Shakespeare'},\n",

Compared to the dire offerings Clancy serves up now such as Red Rabbit, this book is good enough to make you wonder if it was not written by a different author.The plotting is very tight, and action is nicely placed. At 600 odd words this is still a long book, but short for Clancy. The asassination of the American ambassador is as a couple of reviewers pointed out, not until about 300 pages in, but there is more than enough to keep your attention until then. Clancy's strong point was never characterisation, and some of his books I feel just sag with the weight of words (and extraordinarily long chapters). I remember reading other novels of his and skipping paragrapahs here and there. This one I didn't put down until I had finished it.Politically, it's his most sophisticated as well. I always feel that sometimes Clancy was too comfortable painting a picture of the US as whiter than white - here, he brings in elements of moral ambiguity as an illegal war is started in Columbia.There is still enough military hardware and action too keep you going as well - and not too much to overload you. Overall, I feel this is his best work, his most balanced and clever book. If he could produce something half as good as this, it would still be better than the tripe he has served up recently\"},\n",

Before the discovery, they announce their intention to board the boat, only to find two Columbians who speak little and look guilty as sin. The Captain and crew have the presence of mind to record on film permanently what the encountered. They nearly gag at what they find. Contrary to usual procedure, they create a \"justice at sea\" bogus trial based on some ancient mariner\\'s manual. It is just the right scenario to create fear in their prisoners which extracts a confession from them that the Coast Guard believes will stand up in court and get them prosecuted.In Washington, DC clandestine operations are executed for a secret American plan to use the most talented night warriors the US Army has ever produced to fight the drug cartel in Columbia, on their own turf. The select group all have Spanish roots and were salvaged from a life on the streets, where they would surely work against the system, to build a clean life in the Army ... the better alternative.This book shows how power politics, secret hand-shake decisions, and behind the scenes operations occur which could shake up the core values of a country. Clandestine activities work outside the boundaries of national and international law. If they were made  public, there would be a huge outcry from USA citizens and of the world judgement. It is at this time that Jack Ryan becomes Acting Director of the CIA. The CIA Director is in the hospital with a terminal illness ... The current president has not a clue of how the drug war is being fought and won. He is only aware of the results: drug cartel airplanes are being shot down and the US is winning. It is an election year, his main concern is gaining a positive standing in the polls and with  world opinion. He knows very little of reality ... Meanwhile when the second in command of the drug cartel is discovered to have acted on *highly* classified information, known only to a *select* few, the accusations in Washington, DC fly. An insider investigation begins to discover where the leaks occured ... This book is nonstop action and difficult to put down. Each chapter reveals another complex episode which adds another layer of under-handed deals and shady activity, all of which make this a most satisfying reading experience.Although at times this novel is difficult to follow, the subject matter is contemporary and the unfolding events are highly plausible, making it one unstoppable page turner.

Cook, hard-boiled Detective Sargeant and two near-rookies, Gus Ramone and Dan \"Doc\" Holiday. The Palindrome murders are never solved despite the obsession and skills of Cook. Flash forward to 2005. Gus Ramone is married now and has two mixed-race children. Dan Holiday left the police force under a cloud. T. C. Cook, long retired, has been forgotten by nearly all, along with the Palindrome murders.But Asa Johnson, 14, is found dead with a bullet through his brain. No gun. No witnesses. Could the Palindrome murderer be back after a 20 year absence?The hunt for the murderer of Asa Johnson is the leitmotif for this compelling, if sometimes very quirky,police procedural.Gus Ramone is the central character. No superman, Ramone is career cop. Not burned out, but not an over-acheiver either. Ramone, of Italian/Hispanic ancestry has a black wife, Regina, and two kids: Diego, 14, and Alana, 7. Gus loves his wife and children dearly. His love for them and the problems of bringing a mixed-race male through the storms of adolescence form the second leg of the story.Holiday and Ramone have a \"history.\" Holiday is convinced he was a great cop and would have become a legenday cop if it weren\\'t for the straight-laced Ramone in the Internal Affairs Division. Holiday discovers the body of the teenage Asa Johnson and phones the police anonymously. Holiday then teams up with the real legend, T. C. Cook to prove that the Palindrome murderer is back - and to capture him. This is the third leg of the story.The fourth leg is an unsparing tale of the black criminal subculture. This is not for the overly sensitive.These four themes support some of those most masterful storytelling I\\'ve seen in a long time. Pelecanos has the workaday world of the police down pat. No superheroics: just hard work, persistence and some specially skilled people like Bo Greene, who is able to talk murderers into confessing.Ramone has a special interest in the murder of Asa Johnson, not because it is his case - which it is not - but because Asa was a friend of his son. Ramone\\'s work on the case leads down some dark paths, which also brings Pelecanos into some very strange and frankly hypocritical sermonizing. Saying anything more than that would be a spoiler and I won\\'t do that. Concurrent with Ramone\\'s investigation, is the work of Holiday and Cook. Ramone and Holiday seem to bewalking down the road to a showdown.Despite the unwelcome and unnecessary excursions into cultural politics, \"The Night Gardener\" is a terrific police procedural and a social commentary as well.

Though Christians, nor Schaeffer, by no means have a monopoly on such an approach; I found it to be especially unsettling in it\\'s lack of insight into modernism.Picasso, we are told, failed. His artistic goal, to paint the unpaintable, the sublime, was never realized. First of all, to really understand \\'modern\\' painting, we would certainly want to ponder the birth of photography and its influence on illustrative painting.  Illustrative painters were experiencing an identity crisis brought on by the industrial revolution, much like the rest of the entire world except good old Schaeffer.  Artists turned to the \\'sublime\\' because they needed to discover what painting could do that photography could never do: show the unshowable.  And so Picasso\\'s paintings become less \\'realistic;\\' they imply movement, they imply other ways of seeing than the symbolic boxes the modern and postmodern worlds are born into (again, except Schaeffer).  To say Picasso failed suggests no appreciation for any of this, nor does it seem Schaeffer took the time to really analyze a cubist painting, how is it different from what came before? Why? What does it show that a photograph could not? What does it \\'IMPLY\\'! etc.   The analysis of Picasso suggests not an inkling of thought as to why cubism came about FOR CUBISTS (and modernists in general) except for how it makes no sense to a Christian. Thus, the \"this is why Christians have it right\" feel of the critique. I cannot imagine anyone who has appreciated a modern painting or read anything about modern artists swallowing this. Rather, it is for people who find modernism pointless to be able to say, \"oh, they\\'re lost, that\\'s why it makes no sense.\"Lastly, Paul himself claimed that \"we see through a glass darkly.\" The Jews of the Torah (read Old Testament) could not even utter the name of God because of that being\\'s supreme mystery. Composers from Palestrina to Bach attempted to \\'imply\\' something above and beyond their actual art. That is what good art does, Mr. Schaeffer.To say someone failed because they never actually got to the sublime, they never actually clearly illustrated it, never fully understood it, is to indict Paul himself.  Paul admitted his limitations, it is a shame Schaeffer did not turn some of that powerful insight in on himself. Why do you criticize the speck of dust in your brothers eye, when you have a log in your own?'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The idea of the project How Should We Then Live?, both as a film documentary and as a book, was conceived in 1974 and completed in 1976. In the Acknowledgments, Francis Schaeffer writes about the idea behind the project: \"Using my study, over the past forty years, of Western thought and culture as a base, we could attempt to present the flow and development which have led to twentieth-century thinking, and by so doing hope to show the essential answers.\" The subtitle to How Should We Then Live? is \"The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture.\" Starting from ancient Roman times, tracing man\\'s development throughout the Middle Ages, going to the Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment, he shows the steps which led to the modern era.CHAPTER SUMMARIESChapter One-Ancient RomeThe finite Graeco-Roman gods were not a sufficient inward base for the Roman society: Rome crumbled from within, and the invasions of the barbarians only completed the breakdown.Chapter Two-The Middle AgesThe Middle Ages were the post-Roman age: a time of uncertainty in which there were great advances of the church but also great distortions of Biblical truth, eventually leading to the Renaissance and the Reformation.Chapter Three-The RenaissanceAlthough the Renaissance revived the realization that man and nature are important, it went overboard by making man the measure of all things-and by that destroyed the importance of man.Chapter Four-The ReformationLike the Renaissance, the Reformation sought to bring freedom to man, yet unlike the Renaissance it did not lose sight of the Bible and absolute values.Chapter Five-The Reformation-ContinuedThe impact of the Reformation on society at large was the opportunity of freedom without chaos.Chapter Six-The EnlightenmentThe Enlightenment believed in the perfectibility of society, and sought to bring it about mainly by the means of revolution.Chapter Seven-The Rise of Modern ScienceModern science could only have arisen from a Christian foundation: namely, that man is not part of a closed system but can observe and act into the system.Chapter Eight-The Breakdown of Philosophy and ScienceThe foundation in Philosophy and Science was changed from antithetical thinking to dialectic thinking-and because of it reason became more and more pessimistic.Chapter Nine-Modern Philosophy and Modern TheologyDue to the pessimistic view on reason, Philosophy and Theology started to seek meaning in the irrational.Chapter Ten-Modern Art, Music, Literature, and FilmsWhat began in Philosophy now made itself felt in the Arts: the abandonment of reason and increased fragmentation.Chapter Eleven-Our SocietyWe have come full circle, since our society has become like the declining Roman Empire of old: it is marked by the love of affluence, a widening gap between rich and poor, an obsession with sex, freakishness in the arts, and an increased desire to live off the state.Chapter Twelve-Manipulation and the New EliteBecause our society stands on the verge of chaos, we are in danger of coming under an authoritarian elite which will increasingly manipulate our lives.Chapter Thirteen-The AlternativesThe only plausible alternative to authoritarianism is to align ourselves to a Biblical worldview-a worldview which produces freedom without chaos.CONCLUSIONWhether or not one agrees with all of Schaeffer\\'s points, his passion to be a Christian who engages secular culture has laid the foundation stone for much of Christian thinking in the past three decades.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'In this book, Schaeffer illustrates that the reason the world is in such disarray is because we no longer have a moral and ethical foundation to build upon.  This book explores the paramount philosophic, religious, and scientific ideas from the decline of Rome until the 1960s.  He claims that in order to understand where we are today we must trace these three lines in history.  He begins with the decline of Rome (with its amalgamation of Greek values) and proceed through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Romanticism, Industrialism, Modernity, and the post-modern world.  Not only does Schaeffer explore the history of Western philosophy, religion, and science, but also history art, culture, cinema, Christianity, humanism, and communism. Furthermore, there is a flow to history that is rooted in people\\'s thoughts.  Their thought-world determines how they act.  The results of this thought-world (or world view) impact the external world.  Schaeffer points out that individual people throughout the establishment of Western culture impacted the external world with their lives.  These impacts led to the present culture that we live in now.  Many of these individuals shaped our culture to reject a Biblical foundation with absolute morals and ethics to live by.  Instead of this moral foundation, the West is now functioning on top of a feeble, relative foundation.  Schaeffer asserts that this is the reason our culture is in its current hysteria.  He basically divides man and his view on the world into the two categories of belief in an infinite God (Christianity) and belief in the absence of an infinite deity (humanism).  The book provides evidence proving that the Christian belief promotes a solid basis for morals, ethics, and order; however, humanism promotes relativism and chaos.  It is on this basis that Schaeffer proves that without Christian principles, a culture is doomed to failure.  He points out that Christianity gives meaning and beauty to all individual and corporate life.  Anything Short of it brings death to every aspect of life.  Because of this, Schaeffer is not hesitant to point out that the cure for society rests in Christianity alone.  This book was written so that we would \"turn from the greatest of wickedness, the placing of any created thing in the place of the creator, and that this generation may get its feet out of the paths of death and may live.\"The style Francis Schaeffer adopted is straightforward and logical.  He openly admitted that his book does not make a pretense of a complete history of western culture, but enough historical evidence is used to prove his point effectively.  Schaeffer developes his arguments based on the basis that ideas (or worldviews) act on the cause and effect theory.  He also compares and contrasts the Judeo-Christian worldview with secular views to further develop his argument.  Overall, the argument presented is proved in a coherent way.  Although flow of the book is smooth and easy, it also includes a logical message that is vital to the western world.How Should We Then Live? Is a book directed at the West.  As the people of the Western culture we would do well to listen to the message this book portrays.  As Schaeffer effectively points out, if we do not take heed and return to a Biblical moral foundation, the world, as we know it, will continue to spiral down a one-way path to destruction.  I highly recommend this book, and if the intended audience would take caution, and listen to that it is declaring, then it would save us from turmoil and destruction.  This book points out the problem and the remedy.  It would be foolish for a person who has cancer to turn down a remedy that would heal him.  It would also be irrational for is to ignore the cure for our disorderly culture.'},\n",

Chronologically he starts with ancient Rome and goes to the 1970s, the time the book was published. Illustrations are included to assist in making his case. Schaeffer contends there is a flow or pattern to history and in this book he sets out to explain the flow of Western culture. On page 52 he discusses the role philosophy had in separating the influence of divine revelation as found in the Bible from man-made epistemology. He uses Raphaels\\' painting of \"The School of Athens\" (c. 1510) to illustrate the separation. Symbolically the painting depicts two viewpoints, one looking upward toward God, the other viewing lower sources such as man. In Europe this gravitation toward one or the other direction took the forms of the Reformation (God) and the Renaissance (man). He discusses the philosophies of the prime movers in each of the two schools of thought. On page 108 he notes \"Many good things in England came from Scotland.\" One of them being the concept of \"Lex Rex: Law is King.\" The concept was that no one was above the law, that it was the same for everyone regardless of rank or position. He traces the idea for the American Revolution back to these seeds planted in the minds of those of English ancestary. The reader is carried up to the 1970s. This is a thought-provoking book that helps a person see cause-and-effect consequences over the long haul. It reminds one of the observation of Russell Kirk, \"ideas have consequences.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Yukio Mishima is, sadly, known best for the circumstances of his death. He committed seppuku (ritual suicide by sword) after finishing the final book of this tetralogy--The Sea of Fertility. He, along with Kawabata and Murakami, is one of the most prominent Japanese authors that actually gained attention during his life. Mishima was called a radical, a right-winger. Some think that this stigma affects his writing greatly, but hearing someone say that makes me wonder why they\\'re reading him to begin with.SPRING SNOW is the story of Kiyoaki Matsugae, and his Imperially sanctioned and revered family. I thought that it was clear early on that Kiyoaki was an interesting character. He is the image of adolescence in this novel; Honda, Kiyo\\'s best companion (I don\\'t go out of my way to call him a friend), is, I think, more respectable. I\\'m not sure if Mishima, in writing this novel, was masochistic with Kiyoaki and more level-headed with some of the other characters, but it certainly gives us a great perspective in what goes on in Kiyoaki\\'s mind.Kiyo and Satoko were childhood friends; after his interest in her wanes, he\\'s given notice that she is to marry a Prince. \"The grass always looks greener on the other side\"--this is what I think of, looking back on Kiyo and his decision to tell his father that there was \"absolutely nothing\" between himself and Satoko. He goes on to become more infatuated with her presence; \"doomed as it was inevitable\" is what the synopsis says of this romance.The reason I give this 4 stars? I really felt the book could\\'ve been 50 to 75 pages shorter. I couldn\\'t help but get tired of it in places. Another reviewer mentioed that Mishima isn\\'t very inventive, but is very skilled. I agree with that totally. The story itself is not enough to warrant a reading (seriously--I\\'ve read countless other Japanese novels with the exact same romance-based-on-family-strain plot). It\\'s the way that Mishima tells us of his characters, and the settings. I might go as far to say that--yes, I think that he is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.All complaints aside, this novel is amazing, and I feel that I\\'d appreciate it even more if I paged through it again.

The four books are:- \"Spring Snow,\"- \"Runaway Horses,\"- \"The Temple of Dawn,\" and- \"The Decay of the Angel.\"I asked another reader if Mishima\\'s book \"Spring Snow\" was a universal story or a period piece unique to Japan. They were a bit uncertain. The good news is that it is both. It is a modern 20th century version of Romeo and Juliet - or a similar type of theme but not identical to Shakespeare\\'s drama by any stretch -  but having said that,  there are many parallels. It is set in Tokyo around 1912; it involves two families and two lovers; there is a problem betrothal involving the female protagonist Satoko (Kiyoaki is the male); and there are outside forces at work - the Royal family. To say more would be to give away the plot. I am not an expert on Japanese literature but I thought that it rated 5 stars.It is a clear and compelling read, and I sat down glued to the book and read 270 pages the first day. For that reason - along with the beauty of the story and the scenery and the characters - it deserves 5 stars. As I reached the end of the book, I thought that the story faltered slightly. Also, the author is great but perhaps not brilliant nor very innovative. He is touted as being \"like Dostoevsky\" on the book jacket - a quote from the Christian Science Monitor. Yes, there are some fabulous scenes and excellent writing that transports the reader to Japan, and a rickshaw ride through a snowy spring afternoon. But, before reading the book, I had just finished reading the masterpiece Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, and some short stories by Chekhov. In comparison, Mishima\\'s love story seemed a bit light compared to Dostoevsky, but perhaps on par with Chekhov. That is not a bad comparison.In reading the prose, I had the same feeling reading this book as I did when I read some of Saul Bellow\\'s books, especially Herzog. Mishima seems to put a lot of emotional energy into the writing and he says things that are a bit on the edge of social norms. In a society such as Japan, the book must have been a bit racy when it came out.Is it a world class masterpiece? Probably not on its own, but it is exceptional. Taken as a group of four, The Sea of Fertility group might be a masterpiece series. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend the read.As a final note, this book has no introduction or extra notes on the author or the book.

       "  'text': 'For a Japanese nationalist, Yukio Mishima seems to have had an appreciation for European literature, as demonstrated in his wonderful novel \"Spring Snow,\" the first part of a tetralogy.  Taking place in Tokyo in the years following the Russo-Japanese war and just before the first world war, it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed nineteenth-century epic with an almost Tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a Stendhalian romance.  Appropriately, one of its themes is the gradual influx of Western influence on Japanese culture, which Mishima, himself loyal to the Samurai tradition, might well have resisted.Most of the novel\\'s characters are members of the aristocratic society of imperial Japan.  One of these is Kiyoaki, the eighteen-year-old son of the Marquis Matsugae, a noble of the royal court.  Kiyoaki is a handsome boy who attracts many girls but is too sullen and withdrawn to make many friends at school; as it is, his only companion is a bright classmate named Shigekuni Honda who works hard to please his strict parents by studying law.  Kiyoaki has a tutor named Iinuma who secretly disrespects his pupil because he feels that Kiyoaki, representing the moral decadence of the new era, dishonors his ancestors and the dignity of old Japan.  There are also two Siamese princes who through diplomatic channels are acquainted with the Matsugaes and attend Kiyoaki\\'s school; they make a comical duo, at least until the tragedy that calls them home to Siam.The story pertains mainly to the troubled love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko, the daughter of Count Ayakura, whose family is close to the Matsugaes and lives on a nearby estate.  Kiyoaki and Satoko were playmates in childhood, so it is no surprise that adolescence has brought mutual romantic feelings.  However, her assertive and unsubmissive attitude offends his pride; he cannot envision her as his wife.  After he spurns her, she accepts a marriage proposal from Prince Harunori Toin, a high-ranking military officer; the engagement is formalized by receiving official authorization from the Imperial Household Ministry.Satoko, aware that Prince Harunori is a dispassionate drone, consents to continue seeing Kiyoaki, their trysts aided and abetted by Honda and her maidservant Tadeshina, until one day when she wakes up with morning sickness.  Imagine the imminent scandal--a young lady soon to be a princess in a marriage sanctioned by the Empire, pregnant by another man before her wedding!  How could she be so irresponsible, and how could Kiyoaki have such contempt for imperial honor?  This volatile situation involving the reputations of both the Matsugae and the Ayakura families advances the story to a nearly Shakespearean plateau, particularly when Satoko, heeding Hamlet\\'s advice to Ophelia, gets herself to a (Buddhist) nunnery.  Kiyoaki\\'s desperate effort to visit her in the convent during the unseasonable weather indicated in the title ends the novel with a delicate poignancy.\"Spring Snow\" is a masterly composition that portrays a picturesque Japan in transition from the grand ceremoniousness of the imperial aristocracy to the new Europeanized etiquette.  The wealthy Japanese are teaching English in their schools, driving British cars, wearing British clothes, listening to German music on German gramophones, even celebrating Christmas without ostensibly observing Christianity.  Mishima, perhaps identifying himself with the discontented Iinuma, may have seen this as cultural degeneration, but his chronicle implies nothing disastrous about the beginning of the century in which his country, bolstered by the prosperity of its elite, was to become a world power.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I strongly recommend new parents thoughtfully consider Baby Wise in developing your parenting style.Now parents of a 5-month old, we used parent directed feeding (PDF from Baby Wise) from the day we left the hospital and have been pleased with the results. BabyWise claims that that the PDF method will often result in happy, well adjusted, satisfied, children that are pleasant to be around. We have found this to be the case.My one gripe with the book is the lack of scientific, empirical studies on the PDF parenting style. Unfortunately, the book (and I) can only give anecdotal evidence of the merits of PDF based on personal experiences.Born in the 25th percentile weight/height, our little one was on a predictable schedule within a week, consistently sleeping (7 hours) through the night within 7 weeks and has been sleeping 11 hours at night since 12 weeks. When in public, we often get comments that our baby \"is so happy\" and \"content.\" We go out to eat several times a week - without more than smiles and laughs (we have only left a restaurant once - but were able to do so before he cried). We house-hunted 9 hours a day for a week (in and out of the car 10-15 times) and our real estate agent never heard the baby cry - no pacifier. We have been on five multi-hour plane trips without any more than a giggle and coo. One friend was reluctant to hold our baby because she said that \"babies always cry when I hold them.\" Our little one was pleasant and smiley. Does our baby ever cry? Of course! He cries at least one time every day (usually during his predictable \"fussy time\" - a 45 minute stretch before bedtime.) When he does cry, diagnosing the problem is pretty simple with PDF (I\\'ll let you read the book to find out how) - and I still haven\\'t figured out how to differentiate types of crys as the hospital suggested. Just as indicated in Baby Wise, after being put to bed at 9pm, our little one wakes up at about 6:30am singing and cooing and goes back to sleep within 30 minutes. At 7:45am, he wakes up again and greets us with a smile when we walk in the room. Our baby gained weight and height predictably throughout his first few months, moving into the 50th percentile weight/height at his last visit.My sister and several of our friends have used Baby Wise with similar results.Is Baby Wise for everyone? - Probably not. If you enjoy structure and organization and are accustomed to being on a regular schedule yourself, your parenting style will probably mesh nicely with Baby Wise. If you consider yourself a free spirit who enjoys responding to the unpredictability that life often brings, then you will probably find Baby Wise to be restrictive to your parenting style. In fact, we have friends who did not use Baby Wise and ended up with happy, pleasant children as well.Does Baby Wise CAUSE babies to be pleasant and happy? I don\\'t know, but it did work for us and I can only imagine how difficult parenthood would be for us without the principles explained in the book.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'This is the BEST baby book I\\'ve read.  I would highly recommend it.This book shows how your baby will naturally sleep through the night by following the simple routine of: baby eats, baby has awake time, and then baby sleeps.  It\\'s so simple.  It\\'s not any type of a strict routine.  You read your baby\\'s signals, but at the same time teach the baby to eat, play and sleep in blocks of time.  Then your baby will naturally sleep through the night.  It\\'s that simple, and it has helped me soooo much.When I had my first son, I had not heard of this book.  I thought I was doing the best thing by demand feeding, co-sleeping etc.  Unfortunately, that resulted in my son not being able to sleep through the night until he was one year old, eating multiple times at night, and needing someone to lie down next to him so he could get to sleep.  What in the world was I thinking!!  He could have been sleeping through the night in his crib by 3 months old.  Instead, I was totally sleep deprived having to wake up throughout the night to feed him, give him a pacifier, or by simply being awakened by his constant restless sleeping.I now have 4 month old TWINS, which both sleep through the night in their cribs.  Life with twins (and now my first son is two) and using the BabyWise method is soooooo much easier than when I had my son and was using Attachment Parenting methods.  Its amazing.  I didn\\'t read Babywise until the twins were about 8 weeks old.  I was feeling stressed and had no structure for the babies.  I was just trying to \"get through the day.\"  One of the babies would cry every 2 hours, and I kept thinking he must be hungry.  Then I would feed him, but he wouldn\\'t eat much and then he\\'d cry again 2 hours later.  After reading the book, I learned exactly what the problem was: my son was tired, not hungry.  He was waking up from his nap too early and needed to sleep longer.I don\\'t know what I would have done without this book.  Now when one of my babies cry, I know exactly what the problem is.  And actually they rarely ever cry.  As the book explains, just like you and me, when babies get a good night sleep they feel refreshed and happy the next day.  My babies are rarely EVER grumpy or fussy.  I\\'ve had so many people act amazed at how content and happy they are.  I then just explain to them the simple routine of eat-play-sleep from BabyWise.Some people act like \"the baby knows best,\" but they don\\'t!  They\\'re just a baby.  You as the parent need to help teach the baby how to sleep.  If people claim their baby wasn\\'t getting enough to eat, then they were not following the book.  The book clearly teaches you if and when there is a problem.  My babies are chunky, alert and happy.  Now, when I read about parents demand feeding and co-sleeping, I just feel sorry for them because they\\'re making life alot more difficult for themselves.  Eventually they won\\'t want their kids sleeping in bed with them anymore and then the little guys don\\'t know how to go to sleep on their own.  When my twins start yawning, I just lie them down in their cribs and they go to sleep.  I don\\'t have to \"help\" them get to sleep.  And demand feeding....CRAZY.  You\\'re just teaching your baby to snack all day and night.  Then the baby doesn\\'t get a good sleep and so they wake up cranky and tired and want to sooth themselves by eating again.  Its a bad cycle.This book really is amazing.  There are also other books in the series that target specific baby ages, as they get older.  I would also recommend Baby Whisperer by Hogg, but only as a supplement to BabyWise.  Baby Whisperer is not complete about the specifics of the eat-play-sleep routine.Don\\'t get mislead about some of the Ezzo bashing.  Its ridiculous and has nothing to even do with the content of the book.  I\\'ve noticed that alot of demand feeding parents don\\'t like to be reminded that they or they\\'re babies are not sleeping through the night'},\n",

The responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed, and has now set his sights on Kenzie and Gennaro.After the ambiguous villains of \"Gone Baby Gone\", Dennis Lehane returns to a more traditional type of villain for his fifth Kenzie/Gennaro book, \"Prayers for Rain.\"  While nowhere the monstrous serial killer Lehane created in \"Darkness, Take My Hand\" (the second book in the series), the villain of \"Prayers for Rain\" is sinister, smug, brilliant, and sadistic, inflicting pain and death because he can.  Kenzie and Gennaro, in turn, want to stop him out of a sense of justice and vengeance.  The tension mounts as the detectives must struggle to protect their own loved ones and safety while finding a the key to bringing down an invisible and brilliant killer.As with the rest of this series, Lehane explores the basic theme of power: who has it, why they want it, what they do to get it, and what they do when they have it.  At the beginning of each novel, the most powerful character is the villain.  They exercise their power violently, harming people because they can, and because their victims cannot fight back.  It falls to Kenzie and Gennaro to exact revenge, which is usually pretty gratifying, if problematic, since our society generally frowns on revenge.  Nonetheless, sometimes justice is not pretty, and it\\'s understood that Kenzie and Gennaro are in the best position to fulfill that justice.While \"Prayers for Rain\"is the last Kenzie/Gennaro book for the time being, Lehane has not written a \"last\" book in a series.

I hope he does, as I have enjoyed Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro\\'s company for the past couple of years.  \"Prayers for Rain\" embodies much of what is great about this series and Lehane as a writer.

I had to stay up late one night to finish that, and I couldn't sleep afterwards, so I had to read a Dave Barry book to take my mind off it! I should have learned my lesson, because as soon as I got into Prayers for Rain, I couldn't get the creepiness and mystery out of my head, and I once again had to stay up late to finish the entire book.I'm a snob who usually avoids genre fiction, and I have a sneaking suspicion this might be found in the mystery/crime genre section, but Lehane is really a league above the other mytery writers I have read. Lehane is a masterful storyteller and has a rock solid plot here. He's very talented with the psychological aspects of crime (very much so in Shutter Island...I fear my review is becoming a big ad for that book!), and I wished he had further developed some of the psychological aspects in this book.The lesson I've learned about Lehane is that he is such a good and creepy storyteller than I'm no longer reading any of his books in bed late at night. They are only to be digested when I am lying on the beach.  If you enjoy thrillers, definitely get this book, and be prepared to be blown away by a well-crafted plot\"},\n",

Robb, aka Nora Roberts, published her first \"in death\" book, Naked in Death. Since then she has written twenty-two novels and two novellas in this continuing series about Lieutenant Eve Dallas, a futuristic NYPD homicide detective; Roarke, her gorgeous, wealthy husband, and Eve\\'s crime-fighting team. These novels are quintessential police procedural mysteries, with a twist of humor, pyschodrama, sex and sensitivity.Prior to reading this entire series, I had a fear of reading books about the terrible things people do to each other, how we use our wonderful imagination to create pain and terror. I actually used this series to confront my fears and to get past them, for within this series you will find every possible, imaginable form of evil.Each novel certainly can stand alone; however, I read the series in chronological order, which I highly recommend for maximum enjoyment. You will quickly grow to know and love all her characters-Peabody, her partner; McNab, Peabody\\'s tall, skinny loveman; Mavis, her radically-clad, extroverted, singer friend; Summerset, Roarke\\'s majordomo and thorn in Eve\\'s side-to name a few.After reading this series, I can now read anything gruesome or frightening-stalking, dismemberment, blood everywhere, revenge, torture, whatever-and find it prosaic compared to these novels. Now, back to Origin In Death.It is year 2059 in New York City and someone has murdered reconstructive and cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Wilfred Icove. The victim was found in his office with one clean stab wound to his heart and no evidence of a struggle. The case turns bizarre when Wilfred\\'s son dies in the same manner. In both cases they seem to have trusted their killer. Eve\\'s instincts tell her that the father and son had a hidden dark secret and that the motive for the murders . . . had its origin in death.J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts\\'s writing is consistently excellent. She is a consummate artist in any genre-romance, mystery, thrillers, fantasy, science fiction-you name it, she can write it. Since her first book, Irish Thoroughbred, published in 1981, she has written over 300 novels. You won\\'t be disappointed.Reviewer: Kaye Trout - March 16, 2006 - Copyright'},\n",

Baseball is a team sport that captures the American Spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend. Even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game. Likewise, a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the win/loss talley. In Moneyball, Michael Lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game. Like real life, this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the Sports Page. Every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics. There is the so-so pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game, or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track. Lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the LA Angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and hard-nosed business managers can profit from and enjoy.'},\n",

That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball.  One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas.  It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news.  The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up.  Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others.  And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning.  When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point.\"},\n",

Though still a fan, I\\'d not read a baseball book in several years until I finally got around to reading this one.Reading Moneyball four years after the events occured sheds new light on things.  The first portion of the book focuses on the personality and playing history of general manager Billy Beane and then has an inside look at the 2002 amateur draft, where many of Beane\\'s philosophies are put into action.  Beane is ecstatic when Scott Kazmir and Prince Fielder are selected by other teams thus allowing him to get the player he covets, Nick Swisher.  Swisher has panned out nicely for the A\\'s.  Jeremy Brown, the other draftee Lewis focuses on, has not had the success anticipated (he had his first big league at bat just last night).The rest of the book has some interesting moments as well.  There is a lengthy discussion of sabrmetrics and the role Bill James and others have played in shaping the A\\'s philosophy.  Also, a couple of really interesting profiles of Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford which shed some light on the strange paths some people take on their way to major league baseball.Lewis focuses a lot of attention on Paul DePodesta, the assistant GM for the A\\'s.  In fact, without saying so directly, I get the impression that Lewis feels he\\'s at least equally responsible for the A\\'s successes.  DePodesta has since gone on to an unsuccessful sting with the Los Angeles Dodgers.Reading the book a few years after the fact gives some perspective on some of the mistakes that Beane and the A\\'s have made with some player decisions, but despite those mistakes, the bottom line is that the franchise has continued to excel despite being dramatically outspent and despite the fact that the rest of baseball has been \"clued in\" to the A\\'s thinking.As an aside...I find it interesting that all of the attention has been paid to Beane and the A\\'s.  This is well deserved, for sure, but lost in all of this is the fact that the Minnesota Twins have been equally frugal and nearly equally successful.  How have THEY done it?

       "  'text': 'Field of StatsAlthough the steroid scandal may have eventually accomplished the same thing, \"Moneyball\" destroys any persistent romance surrounding professional baseball. It\\'s an antidote to all those paeans glorifying the love of the game: \"The Natural,\" \"Field of Dreams,\" even the raunchy lens of \"Bull Durham.\"  Players don\\'t rise and fall due to the nobility of their character, the sheer beauty of their swing, the sage advice of a wizened baseball scout, or even their batting average, per se.  What Moneyball does is show how the Oakland A\\'s, and a few emulators, dismissed all this lore and culture in favor of multiple regressions and other advanced statistical tools. It\\'s a fascinating book that could have been a dry one--full of detailed statistics and equations--except that Lewis cleverly balances the mathematical perspective with the same character studies that have graced sports biographies for years.The book centers around former big league prospect Billy Beane, a man with great athletic ability who didn\\'t make it in the bigs, partly because of his perfectionism and resulting temper.  Years later, Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with stingy owners who\\'d rather save some bucks than buy a pennant (see \"Yankees, The\"). Faced with a shoestring budget, and enamored with the new baseball analysis cultivated by Bill James in his \"Baseball Digest\" system, Beane and his advisors invest in players as if they\\'re brokers on Wall Street. James and other highly-educated baseball fanatics (often from Harvard, often lawyers or scientists with a mathematical bent) discover that the old wisdom wasn\\'t all that smart:  Their analyses yield cold, objective facts, and suddenly, as in the old \"Firesign Theater\" skit, \"Everything You Know Is Wrong.\"  It\\'s not batting average and RBIs that are most important, it\\'s on-base and slugging percentage that predict the one thing, the only outcome that matters--who wins.  Throw out fielding statistics--these are too dependent on luck and the kind of pitches served up. Furthermore, invest in bargains: Overlooked players who get to first through walks rather than singles (the phrase, \"a walk is good as a hit,\" was never so true as it is here), guys who aren\\'t great all-around players but who fill complete missing elements in your roster (sort of like diversifying your portfolio, Beane and others take their cue from a market mechanism known as \"derivatives\"), and those who otherwise don\\'t fit into other GMs\\' and scouts atheoretical notion of what makes a great player.The results are convincing. With one of the least expensive teams in baseball, the A\\'s repeatedly make the playoffs.  Beane acquires college players and castoffs from other teams like a man who collects trashy art, and XXX shows how his \"I must be insane to offer you these bargains\" style of purchasing ball players pays off, mostly through chapters devoted to one particular exemplar of Beane\\'s philosophy.There are a few problems with the book, as there are a few problems with the stats-driven approach to building your team.  The most egregious of these is Lewis\\' concentration on the successes predicted by statistics.  For a book driven by science, Lewis ignores the other 3 cells of the implicit 2x2 table of success/failure by \"uses Beane method\"/\"doesn\\'t use method.\"  The most significant is the failure/Beane method cell; Lewis just doesn\\'t write about those players who didn\\'t pan out as mathematically predicted.  The only examination of failure is Beane\\'s rather clinical excuse for never advancing very far in the playoffs--in a short series (I.e., when N is small), luck (i.e., the statistical error) tends to become more powerful and empirical \"truths\" suffer as a result.  The fans suffer too, but their enjoyment of the game is always secondary to winning. Therefore, Athletics almost never steal bases (the percentages dictate no), and managerial and player judgment is minimized in favor of the all mighty victory.  You have to admit it works, but when Beane shrugs off the post-season failure question almost with a \"that\\'s not my job,\" you have to wonder whether \"Moneyball\" is enough.  Maybe it\\'s just the best oine can do on a budget. (On the other hand, XXX Lewis to mention--even in his most recently written epilogue--that Beane\\'s right hand man Paul DePodesta was fired after 2 seasons with the well-financed Dodgers.(A 71-91, 4th place finish in 2005 didn\\'t help DePodesta.) Along with this bias towards success stories, XXX reveals a few bad writing habits.  He\\'ll sometimes describe something with  sentences repeatedly beginning with the word \"that.\"  As in: \"That the book doesn\\'t look enough at failures. That the book was a best seller.  That the book was reportedly misunderstood by many when published.\"  Lewis also lapses into a high-falutin\\' prose style, somewhat emulating \"King James\"--Bill James of the pioneering Baseball Digest school of analysis.Still, \"Moneyball\" deserves its reputation and its sales. Beane\\'s number-crunching, myth-busting approach isn\\'t always pretty, but it makes sense and meets the bottom line of both winning and preserving capital. An excellent and accessible book that has it both ways, an argument for using \"cold\" higher math in sports, and a spirited study of the ballplayers who add value to the original purchase, and the GMs who know what it takes to buy low and sell high.'},\n",

In 1993  he began working for the Wall Street Journal until 2000 when he was then the senior national affairs reporter. While working there he won the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing as well as became a New York Times best selling author.The title of this book comes from a theory that Dick Cheney created.  The doctrine states that if there is just a one percent chance of something happening, regarding the \"war on terror,\" the United States is to act as if it was a certainty.  Cheney himself said that \"the war on terror\" was not about the \"analysis,\" rather the United States \"response\" however, this is one of the biggest flaws in policy that the book points out.  The book begins on the day after the attacks on September 11th and takes you through the inner workings of the American political system for the next three years.  It talks about the response to the attacks regarding Al Queda, Afghanistan, and ultimately the war in Iraq.  Suskind divulges intimate knowledge of who knew what regarding the false information given the American public about Iraq.  A lot of this information has become more public knowledge but at the time the book was published, in early 2006, but the book goes into great detail that few others have.The New York Times called the book, \"An invaluable contribution both to the historical record and to the fierce public debate over the nature of the Bush administration\\'s true views and motivations on issues of war and peace.\"  As a historical record it is important for Americans now and generations after  to know the truth and as far as the Bush administration\\'s true views, the cold hard facts presented are hard to argue with.  Knowing what our lawmakers and elected officials are doing allows us to hold them accountable for their actions and is part of the process that has been in place since America was a country.  We need this kind of reporting to inform the public what is really going on so we can do our job as Unites States citizens.One of the most reveling things about this book is that it put the pieces together and shows that if congress or the American people knew everything that was going on behind the scenes, America would never have gone to war with Iraq.  Congress can not do its job if it is not presented with all of the information needed to make an informed decision.  Now it is one of the biggest political issues that has been putting politicians in an election year on the hot seat.  Many senators and congress people who originally were for the war in Iraq have been pulling their support for years, especially when it was reveled that most of the intelligence the Bush administration gave as reasons to go to war were misleading, false, and much of it made up.   Although the Bush administration has been quick to point to other reasons for the diminishing support for the war, using catch phrases like \"flip-flopper,\" is simply not the case.  This is a word that has been far over used and it is important for Americans to note the difference between the flip-flopping of politicans and the need to change their opinions as more information surfaces regarding the intelligence in support of the war.  This is how congress does its job and it is better to have someone in office that can admit they were wrong and fix the situation instead of not doing anything and \"staying the course.\"Free speech and press are some of our most important rights and are a key factors in separating our democracy from a dictatorship.  Along with freedom of speech and press the Constitution provides a system of checks and balances to assure there is no abuse of power from the president.  The system also includes a process called impeachment which allows for a series of steps to be taken for the removal of a president.  Through Suskind\\'s investigation of the Bush administration several impeach able offences that were committed by Bush and his staff have come to light.  Regardless if a trial is set up or not, bringing the information from inside the White House to the public gives the chance to correct the situation and Americans can act as they see fit.  The important part is to have the information to be available through venues like the press so that we are able to make the best choice.If we as a country allow one of our rights to be taken away there is northing to stop it from happening again.  And if we do not know about what is going on in the first place then we lose our ability to act at all.  America has already had the Patriot Act pushed upon us which all but eliminates the probably cause needed, according the our fourth amendment in the Bill of Rights, for any type of searches.  Then America was faced with the illegal wiretapping the Bush Administration set up and used on everyday Americans, and their friends and family overseas.  Recently, President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law.  This allows for the president to hold people indefinitely without charge, sentence people to death based on poor intelligence, and take away the basic human rights of those detained.  The most controversial and disturbing part of the bill is that it allows the president to eliminate habeas corpus, and eliminates most of the Bill of Rights.It is so important to know the information presented in the book that the book was originally recommended to me by a United States Senator currently in office.  United States Senator Stabenow from Michigan recommenced the book based on what a good book it was on the subject of the war in Iraq.  Between the One Percent Doctrine, the renewal of the Patriot Act, and the Military Commissions Act of 2006, there fewer and fewer choices left for Americans.  Right now we are at a time where we have the choice to sit by idly, or get informed, outraged, and take action.  Suskind ends his the book with another quote this time that is uniform in middle eastern as well as western religions.  The quote is from Deuteronomy 16:20: \"Justice, Justice, This you must pursue.\"  As Ron Suskind states, justice is an overused word these days, I implore all to find the real meaning of justice and pursue it for yourself'},\n",

       "  'text': \"This is a book that every American should read.  It gives previously unknown (or little known) details on the 'war on terror'.  Among some of its revelations are:The one percent doctrine was spelled out by Dick Cheney and says that in the 'war on terror', if there is a one percent chance of an attack happening, our response needs to be as if there is a 100% chance of it happenning.  It was driven by the new arithmetic of this conflict - even one successful attack can be devastating, but there are many potential ones, and being 100% sure the attack will happen is going to be almost impossible.The leader of the London 711 subway plot was a known terrorist conspirator who was refused entry into the USBin Al Shibh was tortured but did not breakKhalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) was tortured and he was told his children would be harmed, but he did not break.Abu Zubaydah, the first 'high level' Al-Qaeda captive, was crazy; with 3 split personalities, and actually just took care of travel arrangements for Al-QaedaThe US military deliberately bombed the Afghan offices of Al Jazera, to put pressure on the organisation, resulting in information from the Qatari leader that lead to KSM's captureThere was a Cyanide attack plot by an Al-Qaeda affiliated organisztion that was in the final stages in the US, but it was not authorized by Al-Zawahiriand plenty more.The other interesting insight from the book is the shift in the way the presidency operates with George W Bush.  Previous presidents would rely on the advice and recommendations of their government agencies.  But George W Bush decides based on 'gut instinct', then asks for supporting evidence from the agencies.  Pretty scary !\"},\n",

In the Office; someone peeked in my desk drawer at work, because there is a suggestion for supplies like toothbrush and toothpast and a lint roller, plus some basic makeup. I have this. They didn\\'t find the hair dryer and shampoo I keep in the office bathroom in case I get drenched or sweated out and have to do my hair over at work..hahah. Another suggestion, spare house keys!

The entertainment section has fun things like freezing berries to make colorful ice cubes for summer drinks, and how to buy for a cocktail party.The book ends with all the marvelous things you can do with dental floss, aside from flossing between your teeth.Good for the newly-wed or just-got-first apartment couple.

He enjoys the flag section in the back and he enjoys the first rate gazetteer also in the back.Though it is for more advanced students, it is an invaluable tool for parents who have first and second graders and who assist or tutor their children. When children are first learning to read, they encounter many new words and they frequently ask parents what those words mean. It is challenging for parents to tell children the meaning of a word in terms that are simple enough for a child to understand. This dictionary is very helpful in that respect.While this dictionary has many illustrations, it would be more effective if it had more. But that is not a significant shortcoming. However, I would not use this dictionary as the first dictionary. I would recommend DK Children's Illustrated Dictionary as a starter. It is not nearly as comprehensive but it is simpler and better illustrated on individual words. For example the larger dictionary does not illustrate what a pot is but the Children's Dictionary does. It costs about the same as the Merriam Webster Children's Dictionary but it is worth the cost. There is also a My First Dictionary by Susan Miller which is also simpler and is easy for a beginner to use but it has only a 1,000 words. The explanations of the words are good but it does not include several of the features of the Children's Illustrated Dictionary.What could make this dictionary more useful would be an a table of contents for pages that contain only illustrations or consist mainly of illustrations on a particular subject.

If you\\'ve never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start.  The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous.  If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling \"Blood Meridian.\"Some people will take issue with Mccarthy\\'s grammar, sentence structure, use of Spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof).  Mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning.  The sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and \"breath,\" meaning that they don\\'t always look or sound like conventional prose.  This will be displeasing to some.  As an example, the first line of the book reads:  \"The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door.\"  Now, Mccarthy could have just as easily said \"the candle flickered when he entered the room,\" or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same.Read the first page of the book.

       "  'text': \"For me, this book wasn't primarily about Wal-Mart.  It was about a man who took his principles to work with him and became incredibly significant.  In a world severly lacking in principle driven living, it shines as a beacon.  Here's an example:The closest competitor prices a product at $19.95.  Wal-Mart prices it at $14.86.  Why doesn't Wal-Mart raise their price to $17.95, beating the competition but earning $3 more on every unit?  Answer:  Because Wal-Mart believes it holds a fair profit margin at $14.86 and wants the customer to have the lowest possible price. (Page 94) That's principle driven marketing.I learned about the ten foot rule:  When a Wal-Mart associate comes within ten feet of a customer, he or she is to look up, look the customer in the eye, and speak to the customer.  If the customer asks where something is, the associate does not tell the customer, but takes the customer to the product.  (page 91)  That's principle driven customer service.The development of corporate culture as a combination of shared vision, shared values, shared purposes, and shared expectations was helpful to me (Page 25).  It was interesting to see how the corporate culture was promoted in Wal-Mart.I believe I can apply these principles in my life, so this book really speaks to me.  Forget about your pre-judgments of Wal-Mart, good or bad, and harvest a gold mine of life principles from these pages.  I would use this as required reading in a college leadership class.George A.

       "  'text': \"Wal-Mart is simultaneously admired, feared, loved and hated depending on from which perspective one looks at this giant retailer. In this book, the author's view is that of an insider, one who is passionately involved with the company's growth for over two decades and who has lived by the core principles and beliefs of the company and finally reaching the position of COO and vice-chairman.This book is not a business story of Wal-Mart or a biographical outline of its founder. However, background knowledge of the world's biggest company will help in understanding the basic principles that helped it reach the current position rapidly with a clear vision and determination.Frankly, my admiration for Wal-Mart has substantially increased after reading this book. This is not because I am in complete agreement with what can perhaps be termed as one-sided view for the author. The difference lies in the listing of the 12 core principles on which the company has been built and continues to grow rapidly even after reaching the magic figure of World # 1.In terms of its global sourcing strategy, Wal-Mart procures aggressively from low cost locations especially China. This has resulted in reduced prices and abundant supply of merchandise in America. This practice is often accused as taking away of jobs from America and instead creating sweat shops in China. The book challenges these allegations and explains the global supply chain strategies that need to be emulated by any multinational.What I found more interesting about the book is that about certain assumptions that we may make about business strategy. For example, in simple economic terms, price elasticity of demand means lower prices would ensure higher sales for most merchandise. However, Wal-Mart is driven by customer satisfaction and the commitment to putting an extra dollar into the average American consumer's pocket as the drivers and enablers that increase sales. Price reduction is the effect and not the bait.The incident where a lady customer is given a free frying pan by the manager of a Wal-Mart store, just based on her declaration that she had lost the one she bought in the parking lot while taking it home is a good example of how much the employees are driven primarily by customer satisfaction and not just by sales targets.Learning from competitors is another great trait that has been well explained.Wal-Mart not only excels in customer service within its stores. Its truck drivers for example have helped many people who needed help on the roads especially women struck with vehicle breakdowns during late evening hours. What more can customers expect. No wonder they keep coming back again and again to what is now and will remain the planet's biggest company as long as it continues to pursue its 12 core principles in action and in spirit\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'This review is an adaptation of my review published in Personnel Psychology, Winter 2004 issue.As one of the pioneers in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement, Hollender is evangelical about promoting the implementation of CSR \"in all of its forms.\" I\\'m not sure I know what he means by that. As he acknowledges, it\\'s in the \"mind of the beholder\" because there\\'s \"no firm consensus\" about what CSR means. I certainly can\\'t criticize him for not pinning down the concept. Professor Ronald Sims (2003), in his own book on the subject for instance, has offered five different definitions.  I think Hollender equates CSR with the idea of a triple-bottom line of responsibility and accountability for fulfilling what he thinks should be the financial, social, and environmental obligations of a corporation.Margaret Mead once said in effect that social change always starts and can only start with a small group of people. The small group identified in the book as pioneers in the CSR movement include small business entrepreneurs like Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry\\'s Ice Cream, socially responsible investment funds like the Calvert Social Investment Fund, and a host of advocacy groups or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like the activist group, Greenpeace, and the more reserved Businesses for Social Responsibility (BSR) that was conceived as sort of an alternative Chamber of Commerce.The book gives an interesting account of the different ways in which these pioneers promote CSR among big corporations. One way, for instance, is non-confrontational and educative in trying to \"bring big business [no matter how socially irresponsible] to the table and then move the table.\" For example, BSR works closely with big companies to promote a set of best practices that hopefully will not only further the CSR progress of those companies but also entice other companies not to be left behind. Another way is confrontational, involving pressure tactics and sometimes law suits. Greenpeace, for example, gradually succeeded in pressuring Royal Dutch Shell to choose a more environmentally responsible way to dispose of an obsolete oil storage tanker and loading platform in the North Sea.As you can well imagine, the notion of CSR is controversial and fraught with issues. The authors clearly know that and for the most part deal with the issues relatively well in my opinion. I\\'ll mention and discuss a few of the issues.Perhaps the biggest issue is over what should be the legitimate purpose of business. Hollender, understandably, totally rejects what he considers to be the \"hysterical\" opinion of conservative economist Milton Friedman that CSR is \"fundamentally subversive\" and that the only legitimate responsibility of business is to make an honorable profit. To Hollender, CSR \"in all of its forms\" is the legitimate purpose. Thus a corporation that seeks to ameliorate public problems not of its own making is a more socially responsible company. He cites Coca Cola as an example of a company persuaded by activists to modify its operations in ways to further the prevention and treatment of AIDS among its employees and those of its bottlers and suppliers.Three related issues are over who should be the public corporation\\'s legitimate stakeholders, for what should it be held accountable, and over what period of time. To people in Friedman\\'s camp, the issues are no-brainers. Shareholders are the only stakeholders, the corporation is only accountable for maximizing their wealth and doing so through legal means, and time is marked in quarterly returns. This view is basically that the conventional bottom line is the only one that must matter. To people like Hollender, the issues are also no-brainers. Absolutely everyone and everything, including the environment, along the company\\'s long value chain from initial product resources to product disposal are the company\\'s stakeholders, the company must be held accountable through full and transparent cost accounting to every one of those stakeholder interests, and time is marked in the long run. The conventional bottom line is thus immensely modified quantitatively and qualitatively.I found the authors a bit lax in relying on several of their sources about one important matter bearing on those three issues. The sources were quoted as claiming that boards of directors have a statutory obligation to maximize shareholder wealth in the short term. I questioned that claim, and one of Hollender\\'s spokespersons acknowledged that it was a mistaken claim. But this nevertheless doesn\\'t negate the immense pressure CEO\\'s are under to hit the numbers each quarter. This pressure comes primarily from institutional investors who might as well be surrogates for a statute. It takes a morally courageous CEO and a sustainable company to resist that kind of pressure. In an article featuring Hollender and Bill George, the recently retired CEO of Medtronic, the latter commented that he would say at every annual shareholder meeting that the company was \"not in the business of maximizing shareholder value,\" and he believed he \"got away with that because the results were so good\" (Kelly, 2004).Another related issue is over how much self-disclosure there should be of a firm\\'s CSR performance. Hollender proposes full \"transparency,\" yet acknowledges that it can make the company squirm, as his did, over risking the possibility that full disclosure may end up making the company legally liable for a product shortcoming that might not otherwise ever be known. He agonized, for example, that while one of his products was more \"natural\\' than that of any of his competitors, he was sure some of his customers at least presumed that his product \"was a bit better than it actually was.\" Not being a fanatically unrealistic CSR advocate, he decided to put a \"product self-critique section\" on his company\\'s Web site instead of putting a disclaimer on the product\\'s packaging. It\\'s a compromise, yes, but far more responsible than the values held and practiced by a baby food maker I remember as once having been charged with diluting its product.Another related issue is whether to take a public company private to escape Wall Street analysts and record-keeping requirements. More public companies are apparently going private, and Hollender himself is a case in point. He took his firm private, and that is what it still is today. He points to the private outfitter, Patagonia, as being able to take socially responsible actions much more easily than if it were traded on Wall Street.Yet another issue addressed, and the last one of theirs I\\'ll mention, is over whether a small, socially responsible company should \"sell out\" to a larger corporation. An advantage of doing so besides making a lot of money from the sale is the prospect of a responsible product being introduced to a much larger market. But a disadvantage is that the seller risks seeing its values and practices diminished if not overturned altogether by the larger corporation. The authors describe how Ben and Jerry initially felt they had negotiated a deal with Unilever, the buyer of their company, to preserve the values the two pioneers held dear, only to learn later of some actions taken by Unilever incompatible with the values.The authors claim that the CSR movement has become a \"contagious trend.\" I think that\\'s a bit exaggerated, and the authors offer little hard data to back up their claim. I think it is true that CSR is becoming a more popular topic, but I suspect, and the authors acknowledge, that it lends itself to tokenism or lip service for the sake of appearances or reputation. That\\'s why incidentally I chose to mention the authors\\' examples of Shell and Coke. Shell reportedly regards the North Sea experience positively and claims there is now \"increasingly open and honest communication with the communities,\" yet we read recently that its two top executives were forced to resign after lying for several years about the company\\'s oil reserves (see, e.g., Timmons, 2004). As for Coke, it\\'s frequently in the news for its \"cozy ties to strong arm dictators and rogue bottlers\" and for other alleged wrongdoing (see, e.g., Klebnikov, 2003). I could also have mentioned wrongdoing by some of the other companies the authors cite as making progress of one kind or another in their CSR performance. My point is that with so much harmful wrongdoing being committed by public corporations, I would far prefer to see a relatively more restrained movement, one that \"simply\" calls for public corporations to operate \"harmlessly.\" Achieving that standard would be a quantum leap from prevailing corporate behavior, and I think corporations should direct their resources to taking that leap and not diverting them to the solving of problems not of their own making or to giving guilt gifts through philanthropy or to offering isolated token efforts.The book is intended for a wide audience, including business leaders, employees, and NGOs. I personally think it deserves to be on a best seller list and should be read by the CEO of every public corporation who has yet to decide where to position his or her company on the CSR spectrum. I also think all thoughtful citizens should read this book. It matters a lot.REFERENCESKelly, M. (2004).

I came across this book because Seventh Generation recently decided to sell their wares through Target instead of Wal-Mart.  Most small businesses would love to be courted by the Wal-Mart retailing giant but Jeffrey Hollender felt that Target agreed more with Seventh Generation.  In this book, Jeffrey discusses his thoughts on running a responsible business.The opening chapters were somewhat difficult to get through.  Perhaps it just took several pages for me to get used to his prose?The underlying message I felt was that having a socially responsible business is possible but will require a lot of work on everyone's part.  Everyone is so connected to each other now.   Perhaps an environmental conscious entrepreneur decides to open a chain of organic restaurants and ensures that farmers are paid a fair price.   But what if the restaurant hires an exterminator that uses a toxin that ends up contaminating the soil for generations?The idea is to have a closed-loop business model ... that leaves things in the same condition as when the company began.  For example, think of the credo of camping sites.  Moreover, the closed loop business model is more than just your business but includes your suppliers and customers.  Specifically, there are hidden costs to disposal of things like electronics and the ubiquitous clear plastic bags.  Of course, we every day consumers can throw them in the trash for someone else to deal with.  But someone does deal with our trash and there are some real costs.  The book gives a story of a putrid land in China where a lot of our electronic waste goes.I have always loved companies that are transparent with their business models from a financial perspective.  Transparency is about communicating to shareholders, consumers, and employees.  Transparency is about being candid and introspective on dealings and reasoning for decisions.There are a mixed bag of corporate stories mainly with Ben  Jerry Ice Cream (who is now part of Unilever) and Seventh Generation.  There is of course some mention of Johnson and Johnson's Tylenol case and also on electronic companies like Hewlett Packard and Dell.  There is some applause for British Petroleum for a decision to put no money to politics and Shell who compromised with Greenpeace on an issue in Africa.Surprisingly this is a well thought out book that doesn't get hysterical.

       "  'text': 'Noam Chomsky\\'s critical analysis of U.S. hegemony is on point. He uncovers the U.S. government\\'s recidivism. One particular case was President Reagan\\'s terror campaign in Nicaragua. The excuse was that communism was beckoning at our doorstep. Nicaragua had become the second Cuba in the eyes of the knee-jerk Right. But what really transpired was Reagan\\'s attempt to overthrow the Sandinistas with U.S. trained Contras. When congress became concerned over this injustice (for financial reasons of course) the Reagan Administration began selling weapons to Iran, further financing their terrorist war in Latin America. Reagan in the 1980\\'s wanted regime change in Latin America and in 2006, history repeats its self since George W. Bush is continuing Reaganite policy in the Middle East. The tactics Bush is currently using might be construed as different but the results are still the same. These campaigns aren\\'t much different than George Washington\\'s campaign to eviscerate the Iroquois, which Chomsky briefly alludes to in the book but for more information on the subject I strongly recommend reading \"The American Indian Wars\" by John Tebbel and Keith Jennison. Howard Zinn\\'s book \"A Peoples History of the United States\" also covers this subject.Chomsky delineates about the 1961 campaign called Operation Mongoose:\"Operation Mongoose was the centerpiece of American policy toward Cuba from late 1961 until the onset of the 1962 [Cuban] Missiles Crisis.\" This was a result of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. \"Operation Mongoose, also known as the Cuban Project, is the general name for CIA covert operations and plans from 1961-1962 to destabilize and overthrow the Communist government in Cuba.\" (Quoted from Wikipedia).Chomsky covers many subjects such as the Israel/Palestine conflict, which the U.S. sends more financial and military aid to Israel than all other countries combined. Iraq is also a humongous issue that Chomsky successfully tackles since World War II the U.S. government has participated in more than fifty wars and to this very day is continuing with their plans of hegemony in the Middle East, Latin America and other countries abroad. This is all transpiring either without the knowledge or consent of American citizens.It is estimated that the Bush Administration has spent more than $300 billion in Iraq, and Afghanistan. These are disheveling developments considering the Congressional Budget Office estimates that another $450 billion will be needed in the next ten years. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear weapons program isn\\'t included in the defense budget its part of the energy budget, and intelligence gathering is in the Black Box budget program.It is estimated by 2008 that the U.S. will have 14 nuclear-armed submarines in the Pacific armed with 336 Trident 2 ballistic missiles with 2,000 nuclear warheads.And in spite of this debauchery, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said, \"We\\'re trying to figure out how you conduct a war against something other than a nation-state and how you conduct a war in countries that you are not at war with.\" This is nonsensical hegemony in motion; the bottom line is the Neo-Cons are planning to wage a never-ending war campaign against the entire world. Just ponder on this for a moment. Half of the United States\\' aircraft carrier fleet occupies the Pacific Ocean, plus the U.S. has over 1,000 military bases worldwide.Knowing that this is the case: one must take a step back and become a little more circumspect when gazing at Bush\\'s Neo-Con panorama and inquire about the issues of Medicare, Education, Food Stamps and Veterans Insurance, simply because the elites are also waging a war campaign against the American people. The world is involved in a grave war for its survival against an elite system set up to enslave many and genocide the rest. This book is a comprehensive history of U.S. hegemony gone tumultuously awry. From George Washington to George W. Bush. This book compiles 230 years of U.S. imperialism in the continental United States and the whole entire world.Moreover, I would like to point out to all the reactionaries who\\'ll give my review a bad rating, that this isn\\'t about racism or religion. It\\'s about the elites\\' mad proclivities for empire, and if you don\\'t wake up soon, and see it for what it really is then our world will not survive. Wake up! You reactionaries will not be apart of the new world order ruling class because you\\'re enslaved by it already.As a matter of fact we are all slaves to this system of world government. And in this system, some of us will remain thralls and the rest are expendable. Remember 9/11 was an inside job. The government committed several heinous acts on that day just so we\\'d rescind our Constitutional Freedoms. Chomsky has stated that he doesn\\'t believe that 9/11 was an inside job and I have to say that I totally disagree with his assessment on the matter, but I still think Hegemony or Survival is an essential read that we must all look at.'},\n",

The book quickly soared to the top of most bestselling lists, and briefly topped amazon book sales.  I well imagine Noam Chomsky had to crack a smile, as it turns out that people do take notice when someone questions American authority, and this is what this book is all about.Chomsky rides roughshot over 20th and early 21st century American history in making his case for its long held imperial ambitions.  He traces the ideological origins to Wilson, but he easily could have gone back to McKinley and Roosevelt, the first for plunging the US into the ill-advised Spanish-American War, and the latter for building a military juggernaut that would eventually save the day in WWI.  Chomsky could have even gone back to James Polk, who similarly raised an unnecessary panic and plunged the US into the Mexican War, which turned out to be nothing more than a huge land grab, virtually doubling the size of the US back in 1848.  A book well worth reading is Bernard De Voto\\'s 1846: Year of Decision.In many ways, Chomsky echoes De Voto in his attack on American imperial ambitions.  He brings the scenarios up do date, by focusing on America\\'s new role as hegemon since the end of WWII, after its major rivals were either crushed or severely weakened.  Rather than seek compromise, the US relished its new role in shaping the world for a variety of reasons, ostensibly keeping open a so-called economic free market that favored its corporate interests.No president escapes Chomsky\\'s vitriolic attack, including Carter, who refused to provide badly needed relief following a devastating hurricane in the Caribbean because the island countries wouldn\\'t refuse to renounce Grenada, which had the audacity to pursue a quasi-Marxist line in its new government.  Later, Reagan would crush the small nation to show the American iron hand in the region, which extended back to the Spanish-American War.But, the two presidents who Chomsky most takes to task are Clinton and Bush for using preventive war in new and audacious ways that have severely comprised the role of the UN as an international arbitrator.  Chomsky attacks Clinton on the Kosovo War, and strenuously challenges the Bush White House position of \"just wars\" in Afghanistan and Iraq.The book takes events up to 2004, providing a lot of valuable background information and illustrating the ideological origins of the current \"war on terror.\" He makes a direct link between the Bush II administration and the Reagan/Bush I administration both in terms of language and actions, but points out that while the first set of wars were largely subversive, the current ones are blatantly aggressive and defy all international laws, much less ethics.  You can take Chomsky\\'s aggressive stance anyway you want, but the book is heavily footnoted and the facts he presents largely hold up.  It is nice to see that the mainstream media is finally taking note, and challenging the presidential administration, after giving him what amounted to a \"free pass\" in his first term'},\n",

Such an issue bitterly divided the Founders, but is far older than the United States - Plato dwelled on it in \"The Republic.\"  He saw a democracy as nothing but a wreckless mob, and that they must be ruled like children by \"guardians,\" who live apart from the masses and consider the good of the people more important than their own.Of course such guardians are very rare - for every Marcus Aurelius or Diocletian there are half a dozen Nero\\'s and Caligula\\'s.

He, as are many other Americans, is rightfully disgusted with the idiocy, wanton destructiveness, frightening arrogance and brazen dishonesty of the policies and actions of the current Bush Administration. As he points out repeatedly however in Hegemony, American foreign policy has generally followed a similar, although certainly less destructive, path in most earlier Administrations. His comments on actions by the Clinton Administration in the Balkans, in particular in Kosovo, are enlightening. Underlying his exposition and analysis of the facts is of course his recurring thesis that Americans are deluged by propaganda and lies initiated by the government which are then willingly distributed by most - and unquestionably by the the most seen or read - media outlets.He is right on the mark. It takes very little effort in the current Internet-accessible world to find original sources on most subjects, so finding the facts related to almost any topic or allegation is a few mouse clicks away.

He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don\\'t think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don\\'t think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.On page 9 he states \"In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region\\'s population\" \"The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins\" \"The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course\"What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.I don\\'t understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He\\'s wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn\\'t respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn\\'t attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.Chomsky\\'s claims that Cuba\\'s economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn\\'t Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn\\'t Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn\\'t Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I\\'ve reached my word limit here at amazon.Cheer'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Noam Chomsky is one of the most noteworthy and influential intellectuals of modern times. Whether you like him or not, in my opinion, everyone should read his books in order to get a general yet very insightful view of current political affairs and their historical and philosophical backgrounds. His unflinching motivation to unearth the truths behind many political events, bold character, and extraordinary ability to see and make sensible connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena is absolutely outstanding.This book is a product of post-9/11 era, but contains a lot of information in regards to USA\\'s preceding quests for global dominance, too.On page 2, he mentions a very common trait of humans which one cannot help but accept: \"...a hypothetical extraterrestrial observer might well conclude that humans have demonstrated that capacity throughout their history, dramatically in the past few hundred years, with an assault on the environment that sustains life, on the diversity of more complex organisms, and with cold and calculated savagery, on each other as well.\"There is a very conspicuous fact that the leaders of the USA would not understand in many ways, which is mentioned on page 4 as follows: \"...there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion (\"the United States\" here meaning state power, not the public or even elite opinion.\"When I was a little boy in the 1980\\'s, I was hearing the US military operations (direct or indirect) in Central America, but could not figure out what was happening exactly. In order to see the whole picture, one should read this book and compare with the news published and aired in media channels in those days. One would see that there is a stark difference between the aforementioned sources.The author bases many of his ideas on John Ikenberry\\'s very interesting comment which is \"...a grand strategy [that] begins with a fundamental commitment to maintaining a unipolar world in which the United States has no peer competitor, a condition that is to be permanent [so] that no state or coalition could ever challenge [the US] as global leader, protector and enforcer.\"On page 12, the author argues very successfully the question that many Americans could not find a satisfactory answer in their minds. They wonder why many countries, which exhibited immense support and sympathy to the USA right after 9/11, turned their support away from the USA during the Iraqi war. The book says \"...the global wave of sympathy that engulfed the United States after 9-11 has given way to a global wave of hatred of American arrogance and militarism, and even in friendly countries the public regards Bush as a greater threat to peace than Saddam Hussein.\"Chomsky describes the driving philosophy behind the Reagan and Bush administrations as \"...the US reserved the right to act unilaterally when necessary, including the unilateral use of military power to defend such vital interests as ensuring uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources.\"He describes the motto of the Cheney-Rumsfeld-Powell trio as well above and beyond a defensive instinct and goes on to say \"...officially declaring an even more extreme policy, one aimed at permanent global hegemony, by reliance on force where necessary.\"Another world leader, Nelson Mandela, who had immensely suffered from oppression and repression, condemned Tony Blair for \"encouraging international chaos, together with America, by ignoring other nations and playing policeman of the world.\"The USA made a series of severe mistakes where it forbade other nations on the same issues. On page 26, it is mentioned as \"...after 9-11, often with questionable relation to terror, the Bush administration claimed, and exercised, the right to declare people -including US citizens- to be `enemy combatants\\' and to imprison them without charge or access to lawyers or family until the White House determines that its `war on terror\\' has been successfully concluded.\"The author quotes the famous \"regime change\" phenomenon as \"...regime change does not mean a regime that Iraqis might prefer, but one that the conqueror will impose, calling it democratic...\". This bring the question that how effective, realistic and long-lasting this artificial democracy would be, in the hands of people who have absolutely no knowledge and experience.On page 41, there are interesting statistics as to how some nations think of the USA and its current political ambitions.The following chapters of the book has a great deal of well-scrutinized historical examples in which the USA was, in some way and to some extent, involved politically, militarily, and economically such as the Middle East, Central and South America, and Asia. There are vivid examples about the ideas and presumptions mentioned in the first 40-50 pages of the book. One should read the book for further discussions.There is an interesting fact stated on page 130; Jack Straw of UK released a report on Saddam\\'s crimes in 2002, but it was drawn almost entirely from the period of firm US and UK support, a fact which was grossly overlooked. Of course, this does not mean that Saddam was a fine leader; he was, in fact, a vicious dictator with a perverted mind and excessive cruelty.The USA invented the terms \"Old Europe\" and \"New Europe\" describing the anti-war European countries and countries who gave direct support to USA\\'s Iraqi operation respectively. This discrimination caused some tension among European countries. The details can be found in the book.There is a noteworthy historical turning point in Turkey mentioned on page 135 and onwards as \"...in the end, the Turks proceeded to teach a lesson in democracy to the West. Parliament finally refused to allow US troops to be deployed fully in Turkey...\" and implicitly criticized as follows: \"Strong governments disregard their populations and accept the role assigned to them by the global ruler; weak governments succumb to the will of 95% of their population.\"The following chapters mention the relationships between the USA and countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East (e.g. Balkans, Turkey, Israel, Iran, S.Arabia et al.).The rest of the book presents very strong and useful advice to the US government as to how they can construct and sustain viable, healthy, peaceful, and long-lasting relations with other countries without repeating the old mistakes which were proven to be absolutely wrong and conducive to animosity and resentment. There are very valuable lessons regarding how the entire World can benefit from mutually respectful administrations and how strong, democratic societies can be built on solid grounds.Overall, this book is very much recommended to those who would like to see and understand the current political phenomena which were not covered by some right-wing, biased media.'},\n",

(As an employee, a board member, a community member and business owner.)  In the hands of an unskilled, or manipulative, or misguided (or worse, downright deceitful) facilitator a so-called consensus decision-making process can leave you feeling like your pocket has been picked.  You know exactly what I mean.  When you finish the \"process\" and feel like you\\'ve been hoodwinked into agreeing to something because:- You didn\\'t fully understand the scope of the issue you are supposed to be dealing with.- People with important information about the issue weren\\'t in the room.- A manager who is worried about his ox getting gored has set the whole thing up to \"share the blame\" for some no-win problem he doesn\\'t know how to solve.- You could never get a word in edgewise after your first stated concern stamped you as \"not a team player.\"- And it was clear the boss wasn\\'t going to go along with the decision the group made anyway!Well, the author not only educated me about what real consensus looks like, I feel like I\\'ve been inoculated against the toxic variety.  The book, as mentioned in another review, is lean and mean.  But there is plenty of substance to chew on, including:- A useful comparison of different decision making methods, along with their strengths and weaknesses.- A clear explanation of the considerable power of a consensus process.  (Not the least of which is accelerated implementation of a decision.)- Succinct guidelines on how to start a consensus meeting off on the right foot.- Clear suggestions on how a multi-stage consensus process can be organized.- Specific strategies for dealing with people who engage in unproductive behavior.  You know them as obstructionists, grandstanders, and those who sit silently waiting to strike with critical comments just when it seems the group is making progress.Perhaps the greatest value I found in this book is that it will steer me away from making the same mistakes I have seen other well-intentioned decision facilitators make time and again.  Like not paying attention to simple and obvious things such as laying down ground rules for how people will communicate as they work toward a consensus.  The author even puts words in your mouth by giving you on-point language to use just for this and other such occasions you will encounter while leading or participating in a consensus process.The information is so accessible and useful beyond the topic of consensus that I have no doubt that I will wear this book out in no time.

The jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of DC, Superman and Batman, and below the jacket you'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every DC superhero battling versus their respective villains.With an introduction from M Night Shyamalan, the book presents Alex from his early beginnings as a child trying to create comic book characters and how his mother kind of influenced him (even though he affirms this didn't happen, take a look at her mom's works and try to believe him)He then presents the DC characters one by one (the Batman session has some pages dedicated to the Joker only, no other villains are shown), the early drawings, original artwork from classics and the homage he has paid for covers, posters or special editions. Analysis on the symbols and the myths of each character are used to describe what Ross wants to project with his images. I don't think it necessary to mention which character has the larger amount of pages dedicated to himself only. You get to see in drawings the creative process he follows when creating a piece, the ideas scratched on a piece of paper, the drawings and possible posing and then the final image. There are pictures I has never seen until I got this book, when I first saw them my fisrt thought was ` I need to frame these', which came up as a bad idea as I would have had to frame the entire book.The abandoned ideas for `Portraits of villainy' are presented here in the form of pencil sketches that look pretty well, it is hard to imagine how they would have looked if the project had been completed. His takes on Hanna-Barbera, Mad magazine, Alan Moore, the animated style and World's finest are also present.Then there are pages and pages dedicated to 'Kingdom Come', from the early concepts and ideas, passing through sketches until the realization of the project. The possible prequel that never occurred, `The Kingdom' is also mentioned and the preliminary sketches by Ross are shown.Uncle Sam is also analyzed  near the end of the book in the same way the other projects previously were.Then we have this section called `The process', in which we obviously get to see how Alex works using the book's cover as example. The final part of the book is a very nice bonus, a Batman/Superman special story written by Chip Kidd and Alex Ross created exclusively for this book.Indeed a great piece of collection, this book is a must for comic book fans.

       "  'text': 'As referenced in the preface, according to the Children\\'s Defense Fund, one in every three children lives in poverty in the city of Chicago- a remarkably higher rate than the rest of the country. Alex Kotlowitz\\'s national bestseller \"There Are No Children Here\" depicts the poignant and powerful story of two brothers, Lafeyette and Pharoah, growing up in one of Chicago\\'s most notorious public housing projects, the Henry Horner Homes. Although this is a story of hardship and tragedy, it is also a story of courage, hope and love. Kotlowitz chronicles the lives of Pharoah and Lafeyette as they confront racism and violence in their own community. This extraordinary story exposes the fact that two parallel worlds still persist in this county and how Inner-city America continues to be defined by poverty and violence and is maintained by institutionalized racism and social inequalities.This story is at times difficult to read because for Lafeyette and Pharoah, violence is a part of their daily lives. They witness death, shootings, drugs, the incarceration of their older brother, their mother\\'s struggle to provide for her family and the influence of gangs at an early age- certainly more hardship and tragedy than many adults will face in a lifetime. However, they confront these realities with courage and profound insight beyond their years.The only negative aspect of the book is that Kotlowitz does not chronicle the educational experience of both boys adequately. We are given a brief glimpse into the quality of education that Pharoah receives and his academic hardships and successes, however, we are left with little to no information about Lafeyette\\'s experience in school. Education is fundamental to the future success of children in poor, urban communities and it would have enhanced the story to have more insight into the quality of education that the two brothers received in order to gain a more comprehensive perspective of the inequities that exist in low income, urban communities.When Kotlowitz first proposed writing a book about the lives of Lafeyette and Pharoah to chronicle the experiences of children growing up in urban poverty, their mother, LaJoe, remarked \"But you know, there are no children here. They\\'ve seen too much to be children\" (1). Despite their struggle to survive, we are reminded that they still are children tying to determine who they are and what their place is in the world around them.'},\n",

I was admittedly hesitant to read this work, Pulitzer Prize and all, as I felt the topic a bit narrow for my tastes and it perhaps a bit too much like a high school history lesson.  Luckily, I was very mistaken.Perhaps the author put it best.  \"There is an old American folk tale about George Washington and the Crossing of the Delaware.  It tells us that the new American republics nearly failed in the winter of 1776, that George Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas night, and that his victory at Trenton revived the Revolution.  All of this story is true, but that in not the whole truth.  There was more to it.\"  The \"more to it\" is captured in the pages of the book and followed by footnotes and various appendices that accound for 168 pages, many of which are well worth reading within of themselves.  Fisher accomplished so much in this volume that the lavish praise many have written is richly deserved.  His ability to put into context a very rough 1776 with the Crossing and ensueing battles was simply superb.Fischer and James McPherson are editors of this series, published  by the Oxford University Press, Pivotal Moments in American History.  James McPherson, a wonderfully accomplished historian and contribtor to another series by the same publisher, The Oxford History of the United States (with Battle Cry of Freedom)  will most assuredly oversee works of very high caliber.  I look forward to reading many more of them, with James T. Patterson at the top of my list with his contribution to this series on Brown v. the Board of Education.Lastly I would add that my interest in history rarely includes an appetite for military history.  That said, Fischer does a great job in covering a largely military operation while keeping the interest of students of history who might not otherwise be inclined for the level of research and written detail.'},\n",

All of these books complement each other and Washington\\'s Crossing is the crowning piece that ties much of it together. Washington\\'s Crossing is very pro-American and pays homage to Washington as a great man and leader. Revisionist and alternative views of the making of our nation do not have a place here. Instead, the author focuses on the best ideals that made the United States great such as respect for individuals of all stations, a willingness to listen to the views of others, flexibility and perseverance in adversity and changing situations, the placing of the good of the nation ahead of one\\'s advancement and glory, and decency on the field of war. As a historical record the book is outstanding and tells the story from both sides. The British are not a faceless and evil enemy, but a group of largely decent and capable people trying to do the right thing from their perspective. We Americans should regard ourselves as fortunate in having them as our \"mother country\" and the basis for our own institutions. The various battles and maneuvers of the New York and New Jersey campaigns are described in detail, but not in a minute, mind-numbing matter, and the result is fascinating history.

In short, McCullough's book would be best enjoyed by those looking for a tree-top level of the events of the day. It is an excellent book that will be read for years, and Fischer is complementary of it, but Washington's Crossing is an in-depth look at why the American cause took the course it did and what precisely that means for us today. It is most certainly not history-as-pageant-on-parade. Most importantly, Washington's Crossing does a wonderful job of de-mythologizing the American cause to American readers, while reintroducing the concepts of rare and unique combinations of leadership and service that actors such as Washington, Knox, Monroe and down to the yeoman citizen-militia were in world history.

But I must admit, it is a riveting account of late 20th century American politics, and what it takes to rise to the top. Clinton's narration comes across in a natural, easygoing style, and it surprised me how deeply he thinks and feels about things that really matter. Those looking for juicy tidbits and meaningless chatter will be disappointed. This is a serious account by Clinton, about his strengths, weaknesses, and most importantly, his capacity to forgive his enemies. His early childhood experiences, especially what he learnt from his grandfather, seem to have made a major positive impact in his life. This, and how non-racist his folks were even though they poor, southern folks from the 1920s era, armed him with that all-important Teflon coating needed in politics.Clinton's capacity to forgive is exceeded only by the public's willingness to forgive him. In his glaring personal weaknesses they recognized their own follies, and in his ability to overcome, they saw their inner hero. Clinton, in many respects, was a naked president. This nakedness comes across even in the narration, endearing readers to him and to see in his vulnerabilities an innocent and instant capacity for change. A second or third reading (if you have the time/patience!) brings out more of Clinton's emotional and political entrails. Some trends emerge. For example, Clinton would dream big, would start strong, win, self-sabotage, rally again, win big this time. No doubt this comes from his personality to seek adventure and to relish the pleasure of an impossible comeback. One of Clinton's stated dreams was to write a great book. This book too, has embarked on a similar journey. It started with great fanfare, bestseller, fizzled in the ratings, now beginning to rally. The years pass, I see even his ardent detractors mellowing.....it is possible that this book will finish the journey....it will rally, and win big.

Yet after reading FrKurt Messick's excellent review, I gained valued insights into the inner life  struggles of Bill Clinton. After a few Chapters into his years as Governor of Arkansas, he solidly attributes his salvation to his Wife and Family. I doubt that he can justly objectify his personal status when he endeavors to separate his constant external and internal struggles!He places his personal struggles alongside the weakness of his Brother Roger at the feet of dysfunctional Fathers. As I came to the time of his becoming President, the battery-powered CD Player kept me in the dark about Monica Molinski! That part will wait till I can buy the book...I am closer to becoming an admirer of his position in History as our bright and gifted President, a good Parent and an equally good partner for his brilliant teammate, Hillary Clinton!

       "  'text': 'When Fernand Braudel originally published this text in the sixties, he became a pariah at the Sorbonne.  In retrospect that disapprobation was the kind of seal of approval that \"banned in Boston\" came to embody.  Previous histories drilled deep into one facet of history.  Braudel\\'s was a pioneering effort in multidisciplinary historical analysis.  It captures the historical flow that evolves civilizations, sacrificing only the detail outside the themes.  Even subsequent to \"A History of Civilizations,\" other historians have been unable to write a thematic survey that matches this original.  And don\\'t be tempted to skip the \"soft\" introductory chapters with titles like \"The Study of Civilization Involves All the Social Sciences,\" and \"The Continuity of Civilizations.\"  These tee up the hard topics, like \"The Greatness and Decline of Islam.\"  There\\'s method in Braudel\\'s approach, and it takes patience.  Braudel\\'s translator, Richard Mayne had his job cut out for him.  The complex syntax is that of a French intellectual of the sixties, and it is retained in Mayne\\'s text, but you become accustomed to it.  Don\\'t look for maps or photographs in this Penguin Paperback; the text alone is six hundred pages.  There\\'s only one other book in this space, \"From Dawn to Decadence,\" by Jacques Barzun.  In my view they are complementary'},\n",

To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been \"founded by whites from the North\". Fact is, there were no \"whites\" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race \"browns\".'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. \"A History of Civilizations\" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book.Instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events, Fernand Braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography, history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization. A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the `deep end\\' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader.If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a `time capsule\\' of facts then.'},\n",

If you have ever been to Italy you know that they have a different notion of what it means to live.  Every visit that I have every made to Italy there has been a general strike that has taken place.  The first time I visited Italy this fact mystified me.  Now, I just know that this is what happens and I don't let it bother me.This book is a collection of short discussion on a variety of topics.  The topics covered are as follows:1.\\tApril Fool's Day2.\\tAt the table3.\\tAttracting Attention4.\\tBad Luck Day5.\\tIl Bar6.\\tLe barzellette (joke)7.\\tBasic Expressions in Italian8.\\tLa Befana9.\\tBusiness10.\\tCalcio (Soccer)11.\\tCalendar12.\\tCalling Cards13.\\tIl campanilismo14.\\tIl carnevale15.\\tCelebrations and holidays16.\\tCompliments, appreciation, and criticism17.\\tDating and Marriage18.\\tDriving in Italy19.\\tEducation20.\\tExpressions such as Dio mio!21.\\tEye contact in conversation22.\\tFamily and friends23.\\tIl Ferragosto24.\\tForm of government and politics25.\\tGallantry26.\\tGestures27.\\tHouses and housing28.\\tIntroductions29.\\tItalian films30.\\tItaly on wheels31.\\tThe kitchen32.\\tThe language33.\\tLetters34.\\tMade in Italy35.\\tMa lei non sa chi sono io!

Italians are very expressive people.  They are much more demonstrative than Americans.  This book covers that fact in great detail, and does a nice job of getting the point across.  Physical beauty is greatly prized in Italy, and this will result in more than a few pinches when you are a woman in Italy unaccompanied.Overall, I think this is useful little book to read before leaving for your first trip to Italy.  It won't make a lot of sense before you arrive in Italy.  However, once you are there much of it will become clear.\"},\n",
